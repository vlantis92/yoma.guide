# Stakeholder Mapping

*Last updated: February 2026*

A Yoma deployment succeeds or fails on the quality of its ecosystem — the partners who list opportunities, the organisations who supply rewards, and the government stakeholders who provide legitimacy and reach. Stakeholder mapping is the exercise of identifying, categorising, and prioritising all of these actors before outreach begins. Done well, it shapes your entire recruitment strategy. Done poorly, you spend time on the wrong conversations while the right ones don't happen.

## The Mapping Framework

Map stakeholders into three categories, corresponding to their role in the three-sided marketplace:

![Diagram showing the three stakeholder categories — opportunity partners, reward partners, and government/strategic stakeholders — with example types in each](../images/stakeholder-map-s6k4.png)

**Opportunity partners** supply the activities that youth complete and earn Zlto for. They sit on the supply side of the marketplace.

**Reward partners** supply the products and services that youth redeem with Zlto. They sit on the demand side.

**Government and strategic stakeholders** don't operate on the platform directly but provide legitimacy, funding, policy alignment, and access to youth populations at scale.

Map each category separately, then identify which contacts you already have and which require cold outreach.

## Opportunity Partner Categories

Yoma's platform is built for ten types of opportunity partners. Use this as your mapping prompt — not every category will be active in every market, but reviewing all ten ensures you don't miss viable partners:

| Type | What they contribute | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Online Learning Platforms | Free courses and certifications at scale | Atingi, Passport to Earning |
| Skilling-for-Work Providers | Job-ready skills training with placement links | Umuzi, Girl Code, AWS Restart |
| International Development Organisations | Programme delivery aligned with SDGs | UNICEF, UNDP, World Scout Bureau |
| Private Sector Job Platforms | Job listings and talent matching | Fuzu, Jobberman |
| CSR-Driven Corporates | Youth development through CSR mandates | SAP, Accenture |
| Government Departments | Policy-aligned youth programmes | Ministry of Youth, national skills agencies |
| Entrepreneurship Incubators | Startup and enterprise support | Accelerators, business development centres |
| Philanthropic Organisations | Funding alignment and programme reach | Foundations, charitable trusts |
| Youth Mentorship Networks | Long-term career guidance | Mentorship platforms, alumni networks |
| Educational Institutions | Schools and universities | Secondary schools, universities, TAFEs |

For detailed guidance on approaching and onboarding these partners, see [Recruiting Opportunity Partners](../03-opportunities/03-02-recruiting-opportunity-partners.md).

## Reward Partner Categories

Map reward partners against the ten categories that the Yoma marketplace is organised into. These categories also tell you how your rewards catalogue will appear to youth:

| Category | Who to target |
| --- | --- |
| Airtime & Data | Mobile operators, MVNOs — highest priority in most markets |
| Connectivity | WiFi providers, internet café chains |
| Electricity | Prepaid electricity providers |
| Food | Restaurants, fast food chains, food delivery platforms |
| Beverages | Cafés, juice bars, beverage brands |
| Education | Training providers, online course platforms |
| Lifestyle | Fashion retailers, entertainment venues, leisure providers |
| Health and Wellness | Gyms, pharmacies, wellness services |
| Transport | Ride-hailing apps, bus operators, fuel vouchers |
| Technology – Electronics | Device accessories, software, tech retail |

Not every category needs to be covered at launch. See [Recruiting Reward Partners](../04-rewards/04-02-recruiting-reward-partners.md) for guidance on which to prioritise first.

## Government and Strategic Stakeholders

Government stakeholders don't list opportunities or supply rewards, but their endorsement and involvement shapes what the deployment can achieve. A ministry-backed deployment reaches youth through official channels; a deployment without government engagement has to build every community access point itself.

Map ministries and agencies by their mandate and their likely role:

| Type | Typical relevance to Yoma |
| --- | --- |
| Ministry responsible for youth | Primary government sponsor; validates the programme's mandate |
| Ministry of Education | School integration, credential recognition, potential opportunity partner |
| Ministry of Labour | Labour policy alignment, employment-linked opportunity design |
| Ministry of Health | Health and wellness opportunity design (volunteering, monitoring) |
| Environmental or climate ministry | Environmental impact opportunities |
| Ministry of Finance or Innovation | Funding, tax incentive frameworks, digital transformation agenda |
| National youth agency or body | Direct access to youth populations; programme co-delivery |

### Example: Barbados

In the Barbados deployment, FutureBARBADOS mapped nine government ministries before outreach began. The Ministry of Youth, Sports and Community Empowerment was identified as the primary stakeholder; the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Smart Technology (MIST) became the government co-sponsor. The mapping exercise also identified that the Ministry of Education would be the key gateway for school-based youth acquisition, and the Ministry of Finance the relevant contact for exploring tax incentive frameworks.

## Prioritisation

With a full stakeholder map drafted, prioritise outreach using three criteria:

**Warmth** — who do you already have a relationship with? Warm contacts convert faster and require less trust-building. Start there.

**Leverage** — which partners will unlock others? A government ministry endorsement makes corporate CSR conversations easier. A well-known anchor reward partner makes the catalogue credible to youth before launch.

**Speed to live** — which partners can get active quickly? NGOs and learning platforms with existing digital content can have an opportunity live within weeks. A telco data bundle deal may take months. Map both and start the longer ones earlier.

Sequence your outreach so that your first confirmed partners in each category give you something to show the next ones — social proof compounds throughout the recruitment process.

> 💡 **Tip:** Build your stakeholder map as a shared spreadsheet with columns for: stakeholder name, category, contact name, relationship warmth (warm/cold), status, and next action. Review it weekly during the recruitment phase. It also becomes the foundation for your government and funder reporting later.
