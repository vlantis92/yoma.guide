# Setting Up Your Organisation

*Last updated: February 2026*

> **Before you begin:**
> - Confirm your organisation has a valid company registration document or equivalent legal entity documentation
> - Identify who on your team will hold the initial Organisation Admin account — this should be someone with day-to-day operational responsibility for the deployment

Before any opportunities can be listed or youth engaged, your implementing organisation needs to be registered and approved on yoma.world. This article walks through the registration process and covers what happens once your account is live.

## Registration Steps

1. **Navigate to yoma.world/organisations** and begin the registration form.
2. **Upload your company registration document.** This is required to verify that your organisation is a legitimate legal entity. Acceptable documents include company certificates, NGO registration certificates, or equivalent official documentation.
3. **Complete the organisation profile fields.** These include your organisation's name, contact number, mission statement, and other descriptive information about your work.
4. **Submit the application.** Your submission goes to the Yoma System Administrator team at RLabs for review.
5. **Await approval.** Applications are reviewed within 48 business hours. You'll receive confirmation via email when your account is approved.
6. **Access granted.** The person who submitted the application receives Organisation Admin access. You can then log in and begin configuring your profile and creating opportunities.

> ℹ️ **Note:** If your organisation is operating under an existing umbrella agreement with UNICEF or another global partner, you may not need to submit a standalone application. Check with your UNICEF or GenU contact whether your deployment is already covered. FutureBARBADOS, for example, operates under the UNICEF global agreement with Yoma and did not require a separate contract.

## What Org Admin Access Unlocks

Once approved, your Organisation Admin account can:

- Create, publish, edit, and close opportunity listings
- Access the partner dashboard to monitor completions and participation
- Review youth submission evidence and approve or reject completions
- Add additional Organisation Admin users to your organisation

Your account does not give you access to other organisations' data or to platform-wide settings — those require System Administrator access, which is held by the Yoma team at RLabs.

## Adding Team Members

Your registration creates one Org Admin account for the person who submitted. Add further team members as Organisation Admins directly from within your account settings. There is no limit on the number of admins per organisation, and no approval required from RLabs to add additional users.

From day one, have at least two Organisation Admins set up. A deployment that depends on a single admin contact creates a critical operational risk — if that person is unavailable, the verification queue stalls and youth stop receiving Zlto. See [Roles and Permissions](../01-overview/01-05-roles-and-permissions.md) for the full permissions model.

## The Same Process for Your Partners

The registration process your organisation completes is the same one your opportunity partners will go through. Understanding it from the inside means you can support partners through it accurately.

Key differences to be aware of when onboarding partners: they register at the same URL (yoma.world/organisations), they need the same type of company documentation, and they face the same 48-hour review window. Partners who are covered under your umbrella agreement (if one exists) may have a faster path — confirm this with your Yoma contact before briefing them. The full partner onboarding workflow is covered in [Partner Onboarding Workflow](../03-opportunities/03-03-partner-onboarding-workflow.md).

> 💡 **Tip:** Create a test opportunity immediately after your account is approved — before any youth are on the platform. Completing the listing process yourself, end-to-end, gives you a working knowledge of the partner experience that will make supporting your opportunity partners significantly easier.
