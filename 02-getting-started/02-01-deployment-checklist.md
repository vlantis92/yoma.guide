# Deployment Checklist

*Last updated: February 2026*

This checklist covers everything that needs to be in place before launching Yoma in a new market. Work through it in phases — the sections build on each other. Use it alongside the rest of this guide, which provides detailed guidance on each item.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Before Any Partner Outreach)

These are the internal prerequisites your organisation needs before approaching anyone else.

| # | Item | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Implementing organisation registered and approved on yoma.world | [Setting Up Your Organisation](02-02-setting-up-your-organisation.md) |
| 2 | At least two Organisation Admin accounts set up for your team | [Roles and Permissions](../01-overview/01-05-roles-and-permissions.md) |
| 3 | Stakeholder map drafted: opportunity partners, reward partners, government contacts | [Stakeholder Mapping](02-03-stakeholder-mapping.md) |
| 4 | Points economy designed: Zlto value ranges for opportunities and reward price tiers agreed | [Planning Your Points Economy](02-04-planning-your-points-economy.md) |
| 5 | Staging environment tested: full opportunity and reward flow validated end-to-end | [Staging and Testing](02-05-staging-and-testing.md) |
| 6 | Core deployment team identified and roles assigned | [Team Structure](../06-operations/06-01-team-structure.md) |

## Phase 2: Ecosystem Build (Before Launch)

These items require active partner recruitment. Most need several weeks — start them in parallel, not in sequence.

### Opportunity Side

| # | Item | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | Minimum 3 opportunity partners recruited and onboarded | [Recruiting Opportunity Partners](../03-opportunities/03-02-recruiting-opportunity-partners.md) |
| 8 | Minimum 5 opportunity listings live and published | [Creating an Opportunity](../03-opportunities/03-04-creating-an-opportunity.md) |
| 9 | At least one low-effort on-ramp opportunity available (completable in under 30 minutes) | [Youth Engagement Loop](../05-youth/05-05-youth-engagement-loop.md) |
| 10 | Verification workflows agreed and communicated to all partners | [Verification Workflows](../03-opportunities/03-06-verification-workflows.md) |
| 11 | Zlto values set on all opportunity listings and reviewed against reward price tiers | [Setting Zlto Values](../03-opportunities/03-05-setting-zloto-values.md) |

### Reward Side

| # | Item | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | Minimum 2 reward partners recruited | [Recruiting Reward Partners](../04-rewards/04-02-recruiting-reward-partners.md) |
| 13 | Minimum 3 reward listings live in the marketplace (including at least one accessible low-Zlto reward) | [Types of Rewards](../04-rewards/04-03-types-of-rewards.md) |
| 14 | Airtime or data bundle reward confirmed live or in pipeline | [Recruiting Reward Partners](../04-rewards/04-02-recruiting-reward-partners.md) |
| 15 | Reward listings reviewed with Zlto team — Zlto prices, stock counts, and descriptions confirmed | [Working with the Zlto Team](../04-rewards/04-04-working-with-the-zloto-team.md) |

### Youth Side

| # | Item | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | Youth acquisition strategy documented | [Youth Acquisition Strategy](../05-youth/05-02-youth-acquisition-strategy.md) |
| 17 | Launch event or activation planned (date confirmed, venue or channel secured) | [Marketing and Communications](../05-youth/05-04-marketing-and-communications.md) |
| 18 | Ambassador cohort recruited and trained | [Ambassador Programmes](../05-youth/05-03-ambassador-programmes.md) |
| 19 | Pre-launch social media channels established and populated with pre-launch content | [Marketing and Communications](../05-youth/05-04-marketing-and-communications.md) |
| 20 | Sign-up and registration target set and agreed with your team | [Measuring Youth Engagement](../05-youth/05-07-measuring-youth-engagement.md) |

## Phase 3: Go/No-Go (48 Hours Before Launch)

Run through these final checks immediately before going live. If any of these are not in place, delay the launch.

| # | Check | Status needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 21 | At least 3 opportunities live and visible in the marketplace | ✅ Live |
| 22 | At least 2 rewards live in the marketplace, including one under 300 Zlto | ✅ Live |
| 23 | At least one Organisation Admin confirmed available to handle verifications during launch week | ✅ Confirmed |
| 24 | Sign-up link tested and working — youth can complete full registration flow | ✅ Tested |
| 25 | Pending Zlto behaviour communicated to ambassadors and partners (24-hour delay is normal) | ✅ Briefed |
| 26 | Zlto team aware of launch date and on standby for any reward issues | ✅ Notified |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not launch with an empty or near-empty rewards catalogue. Youth who sign up and find no desirable rewards will disengage immediately. A lean but functional ecosystem — three strong opportunities and two desirable rewards — is better than a larger but broken one.

## After Launch

A launch is not a completion. Within the first two weeks, confirm:

- Verification queue is being managed within 48 hours per partner
- Youth registrations and completions are being tracked
- Re-engagement communications cadence is in place for week two onwards

See [Measuring Youth Engagement](../05-youth/05-07-measuring-youth-engagement.md) and [Managing Opportunities](../03-opportunities/03-08-managing-opportunities.md) for the ongoing operational rhythm.
