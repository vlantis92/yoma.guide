On the right side, three spoke nodes representing verifiers with arrows FROM the centre hub pointing outward: "Employer" (briefcase icon), "University" (graduation cap icon), "Other Institution" (document icon). Each outward arrow labelled "Youth shares credential". Below the hub, a label: "Blockchain-recorded · Youth-owned · No institution holds the data on the youth's behalf." The design should clearly convey that the youth is in control at the centre of all credential flows. |
