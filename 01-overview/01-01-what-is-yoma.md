# What Is Yoma

*Last updated: February 2026*

Yoma — the Youth Agency Marketplace — is a digital platform that connects young people with opportunities to learn, volunteer, and work; rewards them with real-world value for completing those opportunities; and builds them a verified digital record of everything they achieve along the way. It was built by RLabs, a South African social enterprise, in partnership with UNICEF and Generation Unlimited (GenU), and is accessible for free to youth and partners alike at yoma.world.

## The Problem Yoma Addresses

Young people in emerging markets often face a compound barrier: they have potential, energy, and time, but lack recognised credentials, access to meaningful opportunities, and any reliable way to signal their skills to employers or institutions. At the same time, organisations running youth programmes struggle to verify impact, issue portable credentials, and incentivise sustained participation.

Yoma sits at the intersection of these problems. It provides a verified, youth-owned digital identity that accumulates proof of real-world experience — and a token economy that makes participation directly rewarding in the near term, not just in the abstract future.

## The Founding Partners

Yoma was co-created by three organisations:

**RLabs** (rlabs.org) is the South African NGO that built and continues to maintain the platform. They are the technical custodians of yoma.world and provide the System Administrator function.

**UNICEF** is a strategic partner and co-creator, providing global reach, policy alignment, and SDG-linked programme frameworks.

**Generation Unlimited (GenU)** is a global public-private-youth partnership hosted by UNICEF that focuses on expanding education, training, and employment opportunities for young people aged 10–24.

## The Grow / Impact / Thrive Framework

Yoma's design is anchored in three outcomes that good youth engagement should produce:

**Grow** — Youth build real-world skills and experiences that are verified and recognised. Learning opportunities, training programmes, and educational modules sit in this dimension.

**Impact** — Youth generate measurable social and environmental outcomes that contribute to SDG targets. Volunteering, community service, and civic action opportunities sit here.

**Thrive** — Youth supplement their livelihoods through earned incentives and rewards. Employment, data collection tasks, and livelihood opportunities sit in this dimension.

These three dimensions are a framework for categorising the type of value a given opportunity provides — to the youth and to the ecosystem — not a set of separate product tiers. Most deployments span all three.

## Platform Fundamentals

Yoma is web-based and accessible on any internet-enabled device at yoma.world. There is no native mobile app and no offline mode. The platform is available in English, French, Kiswahili, Portuguese, and Arabic.

As of February 2026, Yoma has more than 311,000 registered youth, 4.9 million engagements, and 70+ opportunity partners operating across six countries.

The three core mechanics that make the platform work are:

**Opportunities** — activities that youth can discover, apply for, and complete. Partners list opportunities; youth complete them and submit proof.

**Zlto** — a blockchain-based digital token that youth earn on verified completion of opportunities and spend on rewards. Not a cryptocurrency — Zlto has a fixed reference value and operates as a closed incentive economy within the platform.

**YoID** — a youth-owned digital identity, created automatically at registration, that accumulates Verifiable Credentials for every completed opportunity. Credentials are blockchain-recorded and portable — youth can share them with employers, universities, or institutions outside the platform.
