# How Yoma Is Deployed

*Last updated: February 2026*

Deploying Yoma in a new market does not mean building new software. yoma.world is a shared global platform — organisations in new markets connect to the same instance that serves South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and every other Yoma deployment. What a new deployment actually involves is building the local ecosystem: recruiting opportunity partners, establishing a rewards catalogue, bringing youth onto the platform, and running the operational infrastructure that keeps all three sides of the marketplace active.

## A Shared Platform, Local Ecosystem

The distinction matters. When you launch Yoma in your market, you are not configuring a bespoke tool — you are standing up a local instance of a global marketplace. The platform is ready. The content, the partners, and the youth are not.

This is both a strength and a constraint. The strength: you are not starting from zero on the technology. The platform is production-ready, proven across multiple countries, and free for all users and partners. The constraint: you cannot change platform features to suit local context — what the platform does is what it does. Customisation requests go to the Yoma development team at RLabs; the roadmap and development capacity are shared globally.

The practical implication is that the work of a deployment is almost entirely operational. The technical barrier is low; the ecosystem-building barrier is where the real effort sits. This guide exists because that operational work — partner recruitment, reward configuration, youth acquisition, verification management, reporting — need to be follower to ensure the the technology is adopted to the point that it functions. 

## What Yoma Provides

RLabs and the Yoma team provide:

- The platform itself (yoma.world), maintained and hosted globally
- Technical support and bug resolution
- System Administrator access and platform configuration
- A global community of existing opportunity partners whose content is already listed
- The Zlto team (zlto.co) as a reward backend partner
- Strategic support through UNICEF and GenU's global networks

## What the Implementing Organisation Must Build

Everything local is the implementing organisation's responsibility:

**Opportunity partner network** — identifying, recruiting, onboarding, and supporting the NGOs, government agencies, learning platforms, and corporates that will list opportunities for youth in your market.

**Rewards catalogue** — identifying and recruiting local reward partners (telcos, retailers, service providers), procuring voucher codes or agreeing terms, and coordinating with the Zlto team to get listings live.

**Youth acquisition and engagement** — bringing young people to the platform, onboarding them, running marketing and ambassador programmes, and maintaining ongoing engagement beyond the initial sign-up period.

**Verification infrastructure** — ensuring opportunity partners verify youth submissions promptly and accurately, maintaining the turnaround standards that keep youth motivated.

**Operational communications** — partner support, youth communications, re-engagement campaigns, and stakeholder reporting.

None of this is automated or handled by RLabs once a local deployment is live. The implementing organisation is the full operational engine of the local ecosystem.

## The Implementing Organisation as Ecosystem Orchestrator

The implementing organisation's role is closer to marketplace operator than to programme manager. You are not delivering a single programme — you are coordinating multiple parties (opportunity partners, reward partners, the Zlto team, government stakeholders, and youth) within a shared platform.

This requires a different set of skills and operational infrastructure than running a single-partner programme. See [Team Structure](../06-operations/06-01-team-structure.md) for what this means in practice.

### Example: Barbados — The Good Bank Pilot

FutureBARBADOS, a local NGO, is the implementing organisation for the Barbados deployment of Yoma, branded as The Good Bank. The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Smart Technology (MIST) is the government sponsor. FutureBARBADOS's role is to recruit volunteering organisations as opportunity partners (27 identified), recruit telcos and retailers as reward partners (43 identified across 7 sectors), run youth acquisition targeting 13–20 year olds, and manage ongoing platform operations. The Yoma platform was not rebuilt for Barbados — FutureBARBADOS's admin account was set up on the existing global platform, and they operate within the same infrastructure as deployments in South Africa and Nigeria.

## Why Adoption Barriers Are Operational, Not Technical

The platform works. In deployments where youth engagement has been sustained at scale — Nigeria's 13,000-youth birth registration programme, Kenya's 3,000-youth out-of-school mapping programme, South Africa's 100+ reward partner ecosystem — the success factors have consistently been operational: strong partner relationships, desirable reward catalogues, well-managed verification, and sustained youth communications. The technology has not been the limiting factor.

Where deployments have struggled, the cause has typically been an underdeveloped ecosystem on one or more of the three sides: too few opportunities, an empty rewards catalogue, or youth acquisition that stalled after launch. This guide is structured around the three sides of the marketplace precisely because building them is where the real work lies.
