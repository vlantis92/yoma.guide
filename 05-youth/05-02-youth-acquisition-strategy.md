# Youth Acquisition Strategy

*Last updated: February 2026*

Getting young people onto the platform is the implementing organisation's job, not the platform's. Yoma has no built-in user acquisition mechanism — no paid advertising, no algorithmic discovery, no referral system. Youth arrive because your organisation brings them there. This article covers the acquisition channels available, how to combine them into a coherent strategy, and how to set targets that you can actually track.

## Why Acquisition Is Off-Platform

This distinction is important to internalise early. A technically complete platform with zero youth is a marketplace with no buyers. Before launch, the question is not "what does the platform do to attract youth?" but "what will our organisation do to bring youth to the platform?"

The good news: the platform converts well once youth arrive. The onboarding flow is frictionless (under five minutes), and a strong rewards catalogue gives youth a reason to complete their first registration. The challenge is getting them to yoma.world in the first place. See [Youth Onboarding Flow](05-01-youth-onboarding-flow.md) for the mechanics of what happens once they arrive.

## Acquisition Channels

### Social Media

Social media is typically the highest-volume channel for youth-facing campaigns. In most markets, a combination of Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and WhatsApp broadcast covers the majority of the 13–25 demographic. Short video content showing real rewards — airtime, data bundles, local vouchers — outperforms text-heavy posts consistently.

Platform-specific approaches: Instagram and TikTok work best with short video testimonials and ambassador takeovers; Facebook suits longer-form posts with sign-up links and event announcements; WhatsApp broadcast lists are effective for direct outreach to existing community contacts.

### School and University Partnerships

Educational institutions offer structured access to large cohorts of youth in a single engagement. A school visit or university orientation session can produce 50–200 sign-ups in a morning. This channel requires relationship investment — see [Recruiting Opportunity Partners](../03-opportunities/03-02-recruiting-opportunity-partners.md) for the process of bringing educational institutions on as opportunity partners, which often runs in parallel with using them as acquisition channels.

### Community Organisations

NGOs, youth clubs, faith communities, and sports associations have existing trust relationships with young people. A referral from a community leader converts at a higher rate than a cold social media post. Prioritise organisations whose members overlap with your target youth demographic, and coordinate acquisition outreach with any opportunities you're listing in partnership with them.

### In-Person Events and Activations

Launch events, community days, and pop-up activations are effective for generating concentrated sign-ups in a short window. They work particularly well when devices are available on-site (or youth are encouraged to bring their own), the registration process is demonstrated live, and an immediately available low-effort opportunity is open for completion that day.

### Word of Mouth

Peer referral is consistently the most trusted acquisition channel — and the hardest to engineer. It emerges naturally when youth have a genuinely positive early experience: earning Zlto and redeeming a desirable reward. You can accelerate this with a structured ambassador programme. See [Ambassador Programmes](05-03-ambassador-programmes.md) for the mechanics.

## The Role of Incentives in Early Acquisition

Youth will sign up when they can see, clearly and immediately, what they stand to gain. In the early phase of a deployment, this means making the value proposition concrete before asking for commitment.

**Make rewards visible before sign-up.** Ensure your marketing content features the actual rewards available — airtime, data bundles, food vouchers, event tickets. Abstract messaging about "building your future" is harder to act on than a specific reward youth can imagine redeeming.

**Provide an on-ramp opportunity.** Have at least one low-effort, immediately available opportunity live on launch day — something completable in under 30 minutes with a clear output. This gives newly registered youth a route to their first Zlto earnings and their first Verifiable Credential before they leave the platform. A youth who earns Zlto in their first session is far more likely to return.

**Connect completion to redemption.** Show the maths explicitly in your communications: "Complete [opportunity name] and earn [X] Zlto — enough to redeem [specific reward]." Making the token-to-reward calculation concrete removes uncertainty and gives undecided youth a reason to commit.

## Building a Multi-Channel Strategy

No single channel is sufficient on its own. A multi-channel approach is more resilient — if one underperforms, others compensate — and it reaches youth who are active on different platforms or in different contexts.

A practical structure for most deployments:

1. **Anchor channel** — your primary volume driver (typically social media or school partnerships, depending on your market and existing relationships)
2. **Activation events** — one or more in-person events to generate concentrated early sign-up volume
3. **Ambassador layer** — peer referral infrastructure that builds organically over time
4. **Ongoing comms** — regular social media and direct messaging to maintain visibility beyond launch

See [Marketing and Communications](05-04-marketing-and-communications.md) for content strategy and messaging guidance across these channels.

## Setting Acquisition Targets

Set targets before launch and track them weekly. The key metrics to monitor are: number of YoID accounts created by a specific date (registration target); percentage of registered youth who complete at least one opportunity within a defined timeframe (activation rate — a proxy for engagement quality, not just sign-up volume); and percentage who complete a second opportunity within 30 days (return rate).

Acquisition targets should be grounded in your deployment's capacity on the opportunity side. If you have ten opportunities listed from five partners, you can support a smaller initial cohort well. Launching with 500 youth and five opportunities means most youth will find nothing to do. Match acquisition pace to opportunity supply.
