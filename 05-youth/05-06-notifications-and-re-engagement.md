# Notifications and Re-Engagement

*Last updated: February 2026*

Registered users who stop engaging are one of the most recoverable drop-off points in any digital programme. A youth who signed up but hasn't logged in for a month had sufficient interest to create an account — they just need a reason to return. This article covers how notification tools work on Yoma, what the platform currently doesn't do, and how to bridge the gap with off-platform channels.

## What the Platform Does

Yoma sends email notifications for specific platform events. Youth receive an email when their opportunity completion is approved (Zlto credited, credential issued) and when their completion is rejected (with the rejection reason provided by the Organisation Admin).

These are transactional notifications tied to events the youth has already initiated. They keep youth informed about the outcome of submissions they've made, but they don't proactively prompt youth to discover new content or return to the platform when nothing is awaiting their attention.

## Current Platform Limitations

Two notification capabilities that implementing organisations typically want are not yet available on the platform.

**No push notifications for new opportunities or rewards.** Youth are not automatically notified when a new opportunity is added to the marketplace or when a new reward becomes available. Youth who are not actively checking the platform will miss new content unless reached through external channels. This feature has been flagged as a priority request — see [Roadmap Features](../07-reference/07-04-roadmap-features.md) for the current development timeline.

**No WhatsApp integration.** Many Yoma deployment markets use WhatsApp as the primary communication channel for youth audiences. Yoma does not currently integrate with WhatsApp for notifications, chatbot interactions, or direct messaging. WhatsApp must be managed as an external channel by the implementing organisation.

These are genuine constraints on your re-engagement capability. Working within them requires building an off-platform communications infrastructure that compensates for what the platform doesn't send automatically.

## Off-Platform Re-Engagement

### WhatsApp Broadcasts

WhatsApp broadcast lists are the most effective re-engagement channel in most Yoma markets. A broadcast announcing "New opportunity this week: [title] — earn [X] Zlto" drives measurable traffic back to the platform when sent to a list of registered youth. Maintaining broadcast lists requires collecting phone numbers at registration or sign-up events and obtaining consent to message.

A sustainable cadence of one or two broadcasts per week maintains presence without generating opt-outs. Content that works well: new opportunity announcements with a direct link to the listing, new reward highlights with the Zlto price, and occasional testimonials showing what a peer recently redeemed.

### Email Campaigns

For deployments where youth have reliable email access, a monthly or fortnightly email newsletter keeps the programme visible. Effective newsletters are short — a new opportunity listing, one or two rewards available this month, a brief youth testimonial, and a clear call to action to sign in and complete something. Long emails go unread.

### Social Media Re-Engagement

Consistent social media activity serves dual purposes: acquiring new users and prompting returning users to re-engage. A youth who registered three months ago and has since drifted may see a social media post about a new reward and return. This is why maintaining a regular social media presence beyond the launch period matters — the audience it maintains includes lapsed users, not just prospective new ones. See [Marketing and Communications](05-04-marketing-and-communications.md) for content cadence guidance.

### Seasonal Campaigns

Certain times of year create natural re-engagement windows: school holiday periods (when youth have more time), year-end (motivated by holiday reward redemption goals), and back-to-school season (when youth are thinking about skills and credentials for the year ahead). Plan targeted re-engagement pushes around these moments. A holiday campaign featuring leisure rewards and a back-to-school campaign highlighting learning opportunities with credential outcomes are both well-matched to the Yoma value proposition.

### Lapsed-User Targeting

If you maintain an external register of youth contacts (which many implementations do for monitoring and safeguarding purposes), you can identify lapsed users — youth who registered but haven't completed anything in 30 or 60 days — and send a specific re-activation message. The most effective re-activation messages acknowledge the gap directly ("We haven't seen you on Yoma for a while") and offer a specific, low-barrier reason to return ("There's a new opportunity that takes under 20 minutes — earn [X] Zlto").

> ⚠️ **Important:** External communications using youth contact details must be managed in line with your data privacy policy and the consent youth gave at registration. Do not contact youth through channels they didn't consent to at sign-up. See [Governance and Compliance](../06-operations/06-04-governance-and-compliance.md) for the data governance framework.

## Measuring Re-Engagement Effectiveness

Without platform-level notification analytics, measuring re-engagement is done through proxy indicators. Track traffic spikes after comms pushes — if you send a WhatsApp broadcast on Monday and see a spike in completions submitted that week, the broadcast is working. Track whether re-activation messages produce completions, not just logins. Monitor the return engagement rate (percentage of registered youth completing a second opportunity within 30 days) as a broader measure of loop health; see [Measuring Youth Engagement](05-07-measuring-youth-engagement.md) for how to track this.

Iterate on your approach based on these signals. A re-engagement format that isn't driving completions should be refined — try different calls to action, different reward features, or different timing before concluding the channel isn't working.

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep a simple log of when you send re-engagement communications and what happens to completion and login numbers in the following week. Even without formal analytics, this pattern tracking over time reveals which messages and channels are working and which are not.
