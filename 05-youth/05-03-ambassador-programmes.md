# Ambassador Programmes

*Last updated: February 2026*

Youth ambassadors are the most effective acquisition channel in the Yoma model. Peers trust peers. A young person who has completed opportunities, earned rewards, and can speak from personal experience will convert more sign-ups in an afternoon than a week of social media posts. An ambassador programme gives that peer influence structure, reach, and accountability.

## Why Peer-to-Peer Acquisition Works

Youth in your target demographic are more likely to engage with a platform recommended by someone they know and trust than with an advert or an institutional announcement. This is especially true for youth in under-connected communities who have had limited prior exposure to digital opportunity platforms.

Ambassadors also extend your geographic and social reach. Your organisation cannot be everywhere — ambassadors embed programme presence in schools, neighbourhoods, community centres, and online peer groups where staff cannot easily reach.

In Yoma deployments where peer mobilisation has been used, the results bear this out. In Nigeria, 13,000 youth were trained and deployed for a birth registration programme — community-embedded youth champions were central to reaching that scale. In Kenya, 3,000 youth were mobilised for mapping out-of-school children, with peer networks providing local trust and reach that external organisations could not replicate.

## Designing the Programme

### Selection Criteria

Ambassadors do not need to be the most academically accomplished youth — they need to be trusted, motivated, and connected. Select for network reach (well-connected within a school, community group, or online peer group), platform experience (ideally, they have already registered and completed at least one opportunity), communication confidence (comfortable speaking about the programme with peers), and reliability (likely to follow through on commitments).

A practical first cohort is 5–10 ambassadors for a pilot, scaling to 20–50 as the programme grows. Larger cohorts introduce management overhead that benefits from a dedicated coordinator.

### Roles and Responsibilities

Define what you are asking ambassadors to do. A clear role description avoids ambiguity and makes it easier to track performance. Typical ambassador responsibilities include recruiting new registrations within their school, community, or peer group; demonstrating the sign-up process to new users in person or via video; sharing deployment communications (events, new opportunities, new rewards) through their personal networks; and providing basic first-line support to help peers complete their profile, navigate the marketplace, and submit their first completion.

Ambassadors are not Organisation Admins and do not have access to the verification queue — that remains with the implementing organisation or opportunity partners.

### Incentive Structure

Ambassadors are typically youth users themselves. Incentivise participation in ways consistent with the Yoma model:

**Zlto bonuses** for sign-up milestones — for example, a bonus allocation for each set of confirmed new active registrations — keep ambassadors engaged with the platform and model active participation rather than creating a cash dependency.

**Recognition** carries real social currency if positioned well. Public acknowledgement at events, ambassador certificates, or featured ambassador profiles on programme social media channels are meaningful to youth and cost almost nothing.

**Exclusive access** — early visibility of new reward listings, invitations to programme events, or a behind-the-scenes connection with your team — makes the ambassador role feel genuinely privileged.

**Progression pathways** — ambassador to Youth Champion to a more formal coordination or training role — give committed ambassadors something to grow into and reduce churn at the top of the programme.

Avoid paying cash stipends unless your deployment model specifically supports this. Zlto bonuses are preferable because they maintain ambassador engagement with the platform itself.

## Training Ambassadors

Training should cover four things substantively.

**Platform walkthrough.** Ambassadors should be able to demonstrate registration, opportunity discovery, completion submission, and reward redemption end-to-end, fluently and without assistance. Run through this live in training; do not assume they can figure it out independently.

**Messaging toolkit.** Give ambassadors the words. Provide a short (one-page) reference with two or three talking points about what Yoma is, answers to common questions ("Is it free?", "What can I redeem?", "How long does it take?"), and the sign-up link and QR code. Ambassadors who have their own authentic words for the programme are more credible, but having a baseline ensures accuracy.

**Sign-up targets and timelines.** Be specific: "We're aiming for 50 new registrations in the next two weeks. Your individual target is 10." Vague asks ("do your best") produce vague results.

**Reporting.** Define how ambassadors report progress — a weekly WhatsApp message with their count, a shared spreadsheet, or a brief check-in call. The mechanism matters less than establishing the habit early.

> 💡 **Tip:** The first training session works best as an in-person workshop where ambassadors complete their own registration and first opportunity together. Ambassadors who have genuinely experienced the full loop — sign-up, completion, earning, redemption — are far more credible to peers than those who are describing it second-hand.

## Managing the Programme

### Check-Ins

Brief weekly or fortnightly check-ins catch problems early: ambassadors who are struggling to reach their networks, who have run out of content ideas, or who are losing motivation. Keep check-ins short and practical — what's working, what's not, what support is needed.

### Performance Tracking

Track the number of new registrations each ambassador drives, where possible. Exact attribution is difficult without unique referral links; even approximate data (new registrations in the week after a school visit) is useful for identifying your highest-performing ambassadors and understanding which channels are working.

### Recognition

Public recognition matters to young people. Acknowledge top-performing ambassadors in programme communications, at events, and on social media (with their consent). Create a progression pathway — ambassadors who perform well become trainers for the next cohort; outstanding ambassadors become Youth Champions with a more formal coordination role.

### Programme Renewal

Ambassador cohorts naturally cycle. Youth move on, lose interest, or age out of the target demographic. Plan for renewal from the start: identify your next cohort before the current one winds down, and use experienced ambassadors to train their successors. The Train-the-Trainer model — where Yoma trains your core team, your team trains ambassadors, and ambassadors support new users — is the sustainable structure that makes local programmes resilient well beyond the initial pilot phase.
