# Youth Engagement Loop

*Last updated: February 2026*

Getting a youth to sign up is the beginning, not the end. Long-term platform health depends on youth returning, completing more opportunities, earning and spending Zlto, and deepening their engagement over time. That pattern of behaviour — the engagement loop — is what converts a registered user into an active programme participant. This article describes the loop, identifies where it breaks down, and outlines what the implementing organisation can do to sustain it.

## The Core Loop

The Yoma engagement loop has six stages:

1. **Sign up** — Youth create a YoID account and complete their profile
2. **Discover** — Youth browse the opportunity marketplace and find activities relevant to them
3. **Complete** — Youth undertake and evidence the opportunity
4. **Earn** — Zlto tokens are credited to the youth's balance on verified completion
5. **Redeem** — Youth spend their Zlto on a reward from the rewards marketplace
6. **Return** — The reward experience and awareness of new opportunities drives re-entry into the loop

Each stage depends on the previous one functioning well. A youth who can't find relevant opportunities never reaches completion. A youth who earns Zlto but finds no desirable rewards never redeems. A youth who has nothing new to discover after their first redemption does not return.

## Where the Loop Breaks Down

Understanding failure points lets you diagnose engagement problems and intervene early. The most common breakdown occurs at each stage transition.

**Sign-up to Discovery:** Youth register but don't explore the opportunity marketplace. This is often a first-impression issue — the marketplace doesn't immediately surface anything that matches their interests or context. Remedy: ensure your first batch of listings covers enough variety to appeal to different youth profiles, and communicate directly to newly registered youth what's available and why it's worth their time.

**Discovery to Completion:** Youth browse but don't commit to an activity. Opportunities may feel too complex, too time-consuming, or too unclear about what proof of completion looks like. Remedy: make sure all listings have specific, achievable completion criteria and realistic duration estimates. A low-effort on-ramp opportunity — something completable in under 30 minutes — reduces the barrier to first attempt.

**Completion to Earning:** Youth submit proof but don't receive Zlto promptly because verification is slow or completions are rejected without clear guidance. Remedy: manage verification turnaround to 48 hours or better; provide rejection reasons that help youth understand what to resubmit. See [Verification Workflows](../03-opportunities/03-06-verification-workflows.md) for operational guidance.

**Earning to Redeeming:** Youth accumulate Zlto but don't spend it. This is typically a rewards catalogue problem — not enough variety, nothing the youth actually wants, or everything requiring more Zlto than they've earned so far. Remedy: ensure the catalogue includes accessible rewards (low Zlto, quick wins) alongside aspirational ones. A youth who can redeem something modest with their first few completions has a reason to continue.

**Redeeming to Returning:** Youth redeem once but don't come back. This is the hardest loop closure to engineer — it depends on new content being available and the youth being made aware of it. Remedy: regular new opportunity listings, proactive communications about what's new, and re-engagement nudges. See [Notifications and Re-Engagement](05-06-notifications-and-re-engagement.md).

## The Role of the Rewards Marketplace

The rewards catalogue is the engine of the loop. Without desirable rewards at appropriate Zlto price points, there is no incentive to complete opportunities, and the loop loses its forward momentum. This is why rewards marketplace development and youth acquisition must happen in parallel — launching with many youth and an empty catalogue is as damaging as launching with a full catalogue and no youth.

A healthy rewards catalogue for sustaining the engagement loop has three tiers. Quick wins (50–200 Zlto) — small data bundles, airtime vouchers, food discounts — allow youth to earn and redeem within their first few sessions, validating that the system works. Mid-range rewards (300–600 Zlto) — more valuable vouchers, product discounts, event tickets — provide a medium-term savings goal. Aspirational rewards (1,000+ Zlto) — electronics vouchers, scholarship access, premium experiences — create sustained motivation over a longer engagement arc.

For guidance on maintaining the rewards catalogue over time, see [Managing the Rewards Marketplace](../04-rewards/04-07-managing-the-rewards-marketplace.md).

## Opportunity Variety and Freshness

Variety matters as much as volume. A marketplace with 50 opportunities all of the same type (all online learning modules from one partner, for example) serves a narrower slice of the youth demographic than 15 well-chosen opportunities spread across Learning, Volunteering/Impact, and Employment/Livelihoods. A youth who doesn't connect with the first type of opportunity they encounter should find something different when they look.

Freshness matters because returning youth need something new to do. If the opportunity listing is identical to what it was three months ago, there is no reason for a returning user to re-engage. Aim to add at least one new listing per month, even in a lean deployment. New opportunity listings are also a legitimate reason to send a re-engagement communications push — "New this week on Yoma" is a concrete hook for a WhatsApp broadcast or social media post.

## Designing for the Loop

When configuring your deployment, evaluate every decision against the loop. Does the opportunity supply give youth something to discover on their first visit and on their fifth? Does the verification speed mean youth receive their Zlto quickly enough to maintain momentum? Does the rewards catalogue include accessible options that youth can earn within their first two or three completions? Do your communications remind returning youth of what's new and what they can redeem?

The loop is self-reinforcing when all stages work well. It breaks when any one stage fails consistently. The implementing organisation's ongoing role is to monitor where drop-off is occurring and address the underlying supply (opportunities, rewards) or process (verification speed, communications) issue before it compounds.
