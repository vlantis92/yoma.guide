# Marketing and Communications

*Last updated: February 2026*

Marketing for Yoma is marketing for your deployment — the platform has no global consumer-facing brand presence that will do this work for you. Everything that puts Yoma in front of youth in your market is your team's responsibility. This article covers how to frame the message, which channels to use, how to plan a launch campaign, and how to maintain communications momentum after launch.

## What Resonates with Youth

Three messages consistently perform well with Yoma's youth audience, and they work for different reasons.

**Tangible rewards.** Youth respond to concrete, immediate value. "Earn airtime for volunteering" outperforms "build your digital future." Lead with the reward in your primary acquisition messaging, especially in markets where youth face cost barriers to data and connectivity. The more specific the better — name the reward and the Zlto amount required to redeem it.

**Recognised credentials.** For youth with employment or further education ambitions, the credential message is compelling: earning a blockchain-verified record of their skills that any employer or university can independently verify. This message lands best with older youth (18–25) who are actively thinking about employment pathways or higher education applications.

**Community contribution.** "Be part of something that matters in your community" resonates when the opportunities themselves have visible local relevance — mapping a neighbourhood, monitoring water quality, registering children in their community. The token reward and credential reinforce the contribution rather than replacing it as the motivation.

Mix these messages across your channels rather than defaulting to one. Youth with different priorities will respond to different framings.

## Channel Strategy

### Social Media

Social media is your highest-reach channel for youth audiences. Short video (TikTok, Instagram Reels) works best: 15–30 second clips of youth testimonials showing their Zlto balance and what they redeemed convert better than polished brand content. Authenticity outperforms production value — encourage ambassadors to create and share their own content and repurpose the best.

Static posts and stories work well for information: new opportunity listings, new rewards, event announcements, sign-up reminders. Strong, clean visual design with the reward or opportunity featured prominently improves engagement. Facebook suits longer-form posts and community group announcements; Instagram works better for visual reward showcases.

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp is the primary personal messaging channel in most Yoma deployment markets. Use broadcast lists to send sign-up links, new opportunity announcements, and event reminders to existing community contacts. Note that WhatsApp is not integrated with the Yoma platform — it is a standalone external communications channel. Maintaining broadcast lists requires collecting phone numbers at registration or onboarding events and getting consent to message.

### School and Campus Communications

Schools and universities offer high-concentration audiences. Effective approaches include notice boards and tuck-shop displays, school-based WhatsApp groups (via teacher contacts), and speaker slots at assemblies or orientation events. If you are bringing an educational institution on as an opportunity partner, coordinate the acquisition push with their own communications to students about the opportunity listing.

### In-Person Events

Events are high-effort, high-impact. A well-run launch activation or community day can produce hundreds of registrations in a single session. Key elements: visible rewards on display, a live demonstration of the sign-up process, on-site support for youth completing registration, and at least one immediately available opportunity with a low completion threshold. Where possible, have devices available for youth who don't have their own.

### Earned Media

Local press, radio, and community publications extend reach beyond social media audiences and carry institutional credibility. A concrete, locally relevant story — "1,000 Barbadian youth to earn rewards for community volunteering" — is more newsworthy than a platform launch announcement. These opportunities are harder to plan for but worth pursuing proactively.

## Creating Compelling Content

**Testimonials and case studies.** Real youth talking about their own experience — what they did, what they earned, what they redeemed — are your most effective content asset. Collect these proactively from your first cohort. Video is ideal; a written quote with a photo works nearly as well. Make this a habit, not a one-off.

**Reward showcases.** Feature specific rewards in your content regularly. "This month on the rewards marketplace: data bundles, food vouchers, and free workshop places." Variety and freshness matter — if the same rewards appear in every post, the content goes stale and youth stop paying attention.

**Opportunity spotlights.** Highlight specific opportunities with clear, concrete descriptions: what the activity is, how long it takes, and exactly how many Zlto it earns. Youth making participation decisions need this information; vague "join the movement" content doesn't give them enough to act on.

**Behind-the-scenes content.** Showing youth actually completing an activity — a field visit, a training session, a community task — gives peers a concrete picture of what participation looks like. This reduces the uncertainty that prevents first-timers from committing.

## Launch Campaign Planning

A successful launch campaign has three phases.

**Pre-launch (2–4 weeks before):** Build awareness and anticipation. Announce the platform is coming, tease the rewards catalogue, recruit and train ambassadors, establish social media channels, and brief community and school partners. Goal: warm audiences who are ready to sign up on day one, not audiences encountering the platform for the first time.

**Launch (day of, through week one):** Maximum effort. Launch event or activation, ambassador deployment, first social media push, sign-up link in all channels simultaneously. Goal: first batch of registrations and first completions within the week. Have support on hand for youth encountering registration issues.

**Post-launch (ongoing):** Sustain momentum with regular content, new opportunity announcements, reward catalogue updates, and testimonials from early users. The launch week spike will fade — plan for it, and design your ongoing comms cadence before you find yourself in the trough.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not promise rewards that are not yet live on the platform. Youth who sign up expecting to redeem a specific reward and find it unavailable will disengage and are unlikely to return. Coordinate your marketing content closely with your rewards marketplace launch status.

## Ongoing Comms Cadence

Post-launch communications should maintain a regular rhythm rather than spiking and fading. A sustainable minimum is weekly social media posts (new opportunities, reward highlights, testimonials from active users), a monthly in-person or virtual event or activation, and a monthly ambassador check-in with a content refresh.

Assign ownership of communications clearly within your team. The most common reason post-launch comms fade is that no one has specific ongoing responsibility for them. See [Team Structure](../06-operations/06-01-team-structure.md) for how communications ownership fits into the operational model.
