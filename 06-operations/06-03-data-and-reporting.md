# Data and Reporting

> **Outline:**
> - What data is available in the platform: organisation-level dashboards for partners, aggregate views for system admins
> - Key reports available and how to access them
> - Current limitations: no bulk CSV export (on roadmap for Q4 2026), limited cross-partner aggregation
> - Workarounds for data export in the interim: manual methods, what can and cannot be extracted
> - Using platform data for M&E reporting to funders and government stakeholders
