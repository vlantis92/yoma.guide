# Partner Support Model

> **Outline:**
> - What ongoing support opportunity and reward partners need after onboarding
> - Training approach: platform walkthroughs, process documentation, and partner-facing guides
> - Addressing the documentation gap: partners need process guidance, not just UI walkthroughs
> - Support cadence: regular check-ins, troubleshooting channels, escalation paths to Yoma/RLabs
> - Reducing support dependency over time: building partner self-sufficiency as the goal
