# Common Pitfalls

> **Outline:**
> - Lessons learned from existing Yoma deployments: what goes wrong and why
> - Operational vs technical constraints: the platform works — the challenge is process and people
> - The cold-start problem: launching without enough opportunities or rewards to engage youth
> - The documentation gap: partners who can't self-serve because processes aren't written down
> - Over-reliance on the Zloto team without building independent operational capability
