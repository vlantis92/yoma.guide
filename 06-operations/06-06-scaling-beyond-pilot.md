# Scaling Beyond Pilot

> **Outline:**
> - Moving from a pilot deployment to national scale: what changes and what stays the same
> - Expanding the opportunity partner network: sector diversification, geographic reach, volume targets
> - Growing the rewards marketplace: adding telco partners, increasing reward variety, managing stock at scale
> - Telco partnerships as a growth multiplier: data bundles, airtime, and national reach
> - Longer-term considerations: integration with national ID systems, contributing to Yoma's open-source roadmap
