# Recruiting Opportunity Partners

*Last updated: February 2026*

Opportunity partners are the organisations who create and list activities on Yoma — the supply side of the marketplace. Without enough partners, and without enough variety in their opportunities, there isn't enough for youth to do. Recruiting partners is one of the implementing organisation's most important early tasks, and it needs to happen in parallel with everything else.

## Who to Target

The context document identifies ten partner categories relevant to most markets. In practice, you'll prioritise based on what's available locally and what best serves your target youth demographic:

| Partner type                            | What they bring                          | Best fit for                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Online learning platforms               | Free courses and certifications at scale | Learning credentials, broad reach               |
| Skilling-for-work providers             | Job-ready skills programmes              | Livelihoods credentials, employability outcomes |
| International development organisations | Programme delivery aligned with SDGs     | Impact credentials, M&E data                    |
| Private sector job platforms            | Job listings and talent matching         | Livelihoods, employment pathways                |
| CSR-driven corporations                 | Resources and staff volunteer time       | Impact credentials, brand-supported activities  |
| Government departments                  | Policy-aligned youth programmes          | Impact credentials, national scale              |
| Entrepreneurship incubators             | Startup support and mentorship           | Learning and Livelihoods credentials            |
| Philanthropic foundations               | Funding-adjacent capacity                | Varied, often multi-type programmes             |
| Youth mentorship networks               | Long-term career guidance                | Learning and Livelihoods                        |
| Schools and universities                | Structured learning environments         | Learning credentials, large youth cohorts       |

Start with organisations where you already have relationships. A warm introduction from a mutual stakeholder converts significantly better than cold outreach. Use your [Stakeholder Mapping](../02-getting-started/02-03-stakeholder-mapping.md) to identify which prospects have existing connections to your organisation or government sponsors.

## The Value Proposition

Yoma is free for opportunity partners. That removes the most common commercial objection before it's raised. Lead with what partners gain:

**Youth reach.** Partners gain access to a growing network of motivated young people actively looking for opportunities to complete. For NGOs and learning providers, this is direct beneficiary reach. For corporates, it's a youth engagement channel.

**Verifiable impact.** Every completed opportunity generates a Verifiable Credential on the youth's YoID — a blockchain-recorded confirmation of what they did. For partners whose programmes need demonstrable outcomes (for funders, for CSR reporting, for government relations), this is a significant benefit.

**Dashboard and reporting.** Organisation Admins can monitor participation and completions via the partner portal — without any additional reporting infrastructure on their end.

**Free platform.** There are no licence fees, integration costs, or per-user charges.  At this stage, the platform is 100% free for partners.

**Network effects.** Partners join a growing global network of organisations aligned to youth development. Particularly for smaller NGOs, association with the Yoma ecosystem can carry its own legitimacy.

## Pitching Partners

Don't open with the platform. Open with the mission and the youth.

An effective opening pitch is two sentences: what youth in your market are trying to do, and how this partner's work could reach them more effectively through Yoma. The platform mechanics — creating listings, verifying completions, issuing credentials — come later, once interest is established.

**Keep the ask small to start.** A partner who agrees to list one opportunity is far more valuable than a partner who's still deliberating about a comprehensive programme six months later. Once they're live and see the participation data, expanding is a natural conversation.

**Common objections and responses:**

*"We don't have the capacity to manage another platform."* — Acknowledge this directly. The management burden is lighter than it sounds: creating a listing takes under 30 minutes; verification is a simple approve/reject queue; your team will support them through their first few. Link this to [Partner Support Model](../06-operations/06-02-partner-support-model.md) in your pitch materials.

*"We already have our own systems for managing volunteers / learners."* — Yoma doesn't replace their systems. It extends their reach and adds a credential layer. Youth complete the opportunity through whatever process the partner already uses; they just submit proof via Yoma.

*"How do we know the youth are genuine?"* — All Yoma users have a verified YoID linked to their profile and contact details. Completions are individually reviewed and approved by the partner's own Organisation Admin before any credential is issued.

## Qualifying Partners

Not every interested organisation makes a good opportunity partner. Watch for these signals:

A **good partner** has clear, repeatable activities that youth can apply for, complete, and evidence — and at least one person willing to manage the verification queue with reasonable turnaround time.

A **poor fit** is an organisation that can't define what youth would actually do, can't commit to reviewing submissions within a week, or needs significant customisation of the platform to fit their workflow (which isn't possible — the platform is what it is).

## Building Your Pipeline

Track your outreach in a simple pipeline — prospect name, contact, status (approached / meeting booked / listing in progress / live), and notes. A partner who's interested but slow to move benefits from a gentle nudge with a concrete next step: "Can we spend 20 minutes this week walking through how to set up your first listing?"

Target a minimum of five to ten active opportunity partners before launch. Variety matters as much as volume — a mix of learning, impact, and livelihoods opportunities will serve a broader slice of your youth demographic than ten partners all offering the same type of activity.

Once a partner is ready to join, move them into the onboarding workflow. See [Partner Onboarding Workflow](03-03-partner-onboarding-workflow.md) for the steps from that point.
