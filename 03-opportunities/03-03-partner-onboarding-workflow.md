# Partner Onboarding Workflow

*Last updated: February 2026*

> **Before you begin:**
> - The partner should have been recruited and agreed to participate — see [Recruiting Opportunity Partners](03-02-recruiting-opportunity-partners.md)
> - You should be familiar with the Organisation Admin role — see [Roles and Permissions](../01-overview/01-05-roles-and-permissions.md)
> - If you are onboarding your own implementing organisation (not a partner), see [Setting Up Your Organisation](../02-getting-started/02-02-setting-up-your-organisation.md)

Onboarding a new opportunity partner takes the partner from agreement to active status on the platform. The process is straightforward, but it has dependencies — particularly the 48-hour review window — that need to be factored into your launch timeline.

## The Registration Flow

Partners register themselves on the platform. Your role is to guide them through it, not do it for them — Organisation Admin access is tied to the individual who completes the registration.

1. **Partner navigates to yoma.world/organisations** and clicks to register a new organisation.
2. **Uploads company registration documentation.** This is a standard legal registration document confirming the organisation is a legitimate entity. The specific document varies by country (e.g., certificate of incorporation, NPO registration, business registration).
3. **Completes the organisation profile fields:** contact number, organisation name, mission statement, website, and other details that will appear on their public partner profile.
4. **Submits the application for review.** The partner will receive a confirmation that the application is under review.
5. **Yoma/RLabs reviews the application** — typically within 48 hours on business days.
6. **On approval, Organisation Admin access is granted.** The partner receives a notification and can now log in with full admin access to their organisation on Yoma.

> ⚠️ **Important:** The 48-hour review window applies on business days in South Africa (where the Yoma/RLabs team is based). If you're onboarding partners ahead of a launch deadline, submit registrations with at least three business days of buffer. Approval can occasionally take longer if documentation is incomplete or unclear.

## What Happens If Approval Is Delayed

If a partner's application has not been approved after 48 business hours, check the following:

- Confirm the partner uploaded the correct documentation. A blurry image, an expired document, or the wrong type of registration document are the most common causes of delay.
- Contact the Yoma/RLabs support team directly with the organisation name and registration date, and ask them to check the application status.
- In the meantime, the partner can still prepare their opportunity listings offline so they're ready to publish immediately on approval.

## What Organisation Admin Access Enables

Once approved, the partner's designated Organisation Admin can:

- Create and publish opportunity listings
- Edit and manage their existing listings
- View and manage their organisation profile
- Review youth completion submissions and approve or reject them
- View participation data and analytics for their opportunities

They cannot see other organisations' data, access platform-wide settings, or modify anything outside their own organisation's scope. For the full permissions breakdown, see [Roles and Permissions](../01-overview/01-05-roles-and-permissions.md).

> ℹ️ **Note:** A single Organisation Admin account can add further users from their organisation with the same admin level — there's no hierarchy within an organisation. Multiple team members can share verification and management responsibilities.

## Post-Onboarding: Training the Partner

Yoma does not provide onboarding documentation or training materials for new partners. This is a known gap — and filling it is one of the implementing organisation's most important responsibilities.

The recommended approach is a **train-the-trainer model:**

1. Your implementing organisation trains a core group of Youth Champions or team members on the platform.
2. Those trained individuals deliver partner onboarding sessions — either one-to-one or in small groups.
3. During the pilot phase, a Yoma representative can shadow training sessions and provide quality assurance.
4. Post-pilot, the Yoma team provides periodic support to your organisation rather than to individual partners directly.

A partner onboarding session should cover, at minimum:

- How to create an opportunity listing (walk through [Creating an Opportunity](03-04-creating-an-opportunity.md) together)
- How to review and approve completion submissions (walk through [Verification Workflows](03-06-verification-workflows.md))
- What happens when a completion is approved (credentials issued, Zlto awarded)
- Who to contact within your organisation if they have questions

The goal is partners who can self-serve. A partner who needs to call you to approve every submission, or who doesn't know how to edit a listing, is a support overhead that compounds as your network grows. Invest in the training session upfront.
