# Creating an Opportunity

*Last updated: February 2026*

> **Before you begin:**

> - You need Organisation Admin access to your Yoma account — see [Roles and Permissions](../01-overview/01-05-roles-and-permissions.md)

Creating an opportunity listing is the core task for every opportunity partner. The form is straightforward, but the decisions behind each field — particularly the Zlto value, verification method, and opportunity description — deserve careful thought. This article walks through every field and the considerations behind each.

## The Creation Flow

Organisation Admins create opportunities from within the partner portal on yoma.world. Once logged in, navigate to your organisation's dashboard and select "Create Opportunity." The form covers the following fields, grouped here by category.

## Core Details

**Title** — The name of the opportunity as youth will see it in the marketplace. Keep it specific and action-oriented: "Water Quality Monitoring in Bridgetown" works better than "Environmental Volunteer Opportunity." Youth scan titles quickly; make yours easy to understand at a glance.

**Description** — The most important field on the form. A strong description answers four questions a youth will have: What will I actually do? What skills or experience do I need? How long will it take? What proof of completion do I need to submit? Write in plain language pitched at your target age group. Avoid organisational jargon.

**Type** — Choose from:
- *Learning* — for courses, training, and skills-building activities
- *Volunteering / Impact* — for community service and social impact activities
- *Employment / Livelihoods* — for work experience, paid tasks, and employment pathways

The type categorises the opportunity and is recorded in the Verifiable Credential issued on completion — but all three types currently use the same credential schema. See [Credentials and Skills](03-07-credentials-and-skills.md) for how credentials work.

**Category** — A sub-classification within the opportunity type. Select the category that best describes the subject area (environment, health, digital skills, entrepreneurship, etc.).

## Skills and Credentials

**Skills tags** — Tags that describe the competencies youth will develop or demonstrate by completing the opportunity. These appear on the Verifiable Credential issued to the youth's YoID, enriching their profile with specific, searchable skills. Choose tags deliberately — they are part of what makes the credential useful to employers and institutions.

> 💡 **Tip:** Think about skills from the youth's perspective, not the organisation's. "Community data collection" is more useful on a youth's credential record than an internal programme title. Choose tags that would mean something to a future employer or university admissions office.

## Zlto Value and Duration

**Zlto value** — The number of Zlto tokens youth will earn upon verified completion. This is set by the partner at listing creation and can be edited after publication. For calibration guidance, see [Setting Zlto Values](03-05-setting-zloto-values.md). As a starting reference: low-effort activities typically range from 50–150 Zlto; significant time contributions from 300–500 Zlto.

**Duration** — The expected time commitment, used to help youth decide whether this opportunity fits their availability. Be realistic — if you understate duration, youth may feel misled; if you overstate it, participation drops.

## Verification

**Verification method** — How you'll confirm that a youth has genuinely completed the opportunity. Two options are available:

- *Manual review* — Youth upload evidence (photo, certificate, written reflection, data submission); you review and approve or reject each submission individually or in batches. Best for most opportunities.
- *Verification link / QR code* — You generate a link or QR code that youth scan or click to auto-claim the credential. Best for in-person events and attendance-based activities where physical presence is the proof.

Choose your verification method carefully — it affects the admin workload on your team and the security of the credential. See [Verification Workflows](03-06-verification-workflows.md) for a full comparison of both approaches.

## Targeting

**Geographic targeting** — Specify which country or region this opportunity is available in. This ensures youth only see opportunities that are relevant and accessible to them. For online opportunities with no geographic restriction, you can set this to global.

## Publishing Your Listing

Once all required fields are complete, publish the listing. It will immediately appear in the Yoma opportunity marketplace and be visible to youth in the targeted geography.

Before publishing, do a quick review pass:

1. Read the title and description as a youth would. Is it clear what they're being asked to do?
2. Check the Zlto value against similar listings in your deployment. Does it feel proportionate?
3. Confirm the verification method matches what your team can actually manage. Manual review requires capacity to respond within a reasonable turnaround — see [Verification Workflows](03-06-verification-workflows.md) for the 48-hour benchmark.
4. Verify the geographic targeting is correct.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Once youth start applying and submitting completions, some fields become more disruptive to change (particularly the verification method and Zlto value). Make sure these are right before you publish. You can edit most fields after publication, but be aware of the impact on youth who are already partway through.
