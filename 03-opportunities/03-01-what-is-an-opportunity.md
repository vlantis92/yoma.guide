# What Is an Opportunity

*Last updated: February 2026*

Opportunities are the supply side of the Yoma ecosystem — the activities youth complete to earn Zlto and build their digital identity. Understanding what an opportunity is, and what makes one work well, is the foundation for everything else in this section.

## The Definition

An **opportunity** on Yoma is a structured activity that a young person can discover, apply for (or simply engage with), complete, and have verified. On verification, two things happen automatically: Zlto tokens are credited to the youth's balance, and a Verifiable Credential is issued to their YoID.

That combination — immediate token reward plus a lasting credential — is what makes opportunities distinct from generic volunteering or training. Youth aren't just doing something worthwhile; they're building a verifiable record of it.

## The Three Opportunity Types

Every opportunity on Yoma is categorised as one of three types. The type describes the nature of the activity, maps to the Grow / Impact / Thrive framework, and is recorded in the Verifiable Credential issued on completion — but all three currently use the same credential schema. See [Credentials and Skills](03-07-credentials-and-skills.md) for more on how credentials work.

**Learning** opportunities cover skills-building, courses, and educational milestones — the **Grow** dimension. Examples: completing a digital literacy module, finishing an online certificate programme, attending a vocational training session.

**Volunteering / Impact** opportunities cover community service, social initiatives, and activities that generate measurable social or environmental outcomes — the **Impact** dimension. Examples: mapping out-of-school children, water quality monitoring, community clean-up programmes, health awareness campaigns.

**Employment / Livelihoods** opportunities cover work experience, internships, freelance tasks, and income-generating activities — the **Thrive** dimension. Examples: completing a data collection task, participating in a gig economy assignment, attending a job-readiness programme with an employment outcome.

## What Makes a Good Opportunity

Not every activity translates well into a Yoma opportunity. Strong opportunities share four characteristics:

**Clear scope.** Youth can read the listing and understand exactly what they're being asked to do, how long it will take, and what they'll produce or demonstrate as proof of completion. Vague opportunities confuse youth and create verification headaches for partners.

**Achievable by your target demographic.** An opportunity pitched at youth with no prior experience should not require specialist tools or knowledge. Consider who will actually apply and whether the activity is within reach for that group.

**Verifiable completion.** There must be a concrete output — a photo, certificate, data submission, attendance record — that a partner admin can review and approve or reject. Activities that can't be evidenced can't be verified. See [Verification Workflows](03-06-verification-workflows.md) for the full mechanics.

**Proportionate Zlto reward.** The Zlto value should reflect the effort genuinely required. An opportunity that takes three hours deserves a meaningfully different value than one that takes ten minutes. See [Setting Zlto Values](03-05-setting-zloto-values.md) for calibration guidance.

## Examples from Existing Deployments

Yoma's existing deployments span a wide range of opportunity types. A few that illustrate the breadth well:

**Kenya — Mapping Out-of-School Children:** 3,000 youth were deployed to identify and record out-of-school children in their communities. The data they generated informed educational interventions and was submitted as structured records — verifiable, impactful, and directly tied to a national development challenge. Programme costs were reduced by 90% compared to conventional data collection methods.

**Nigeria — Birth Registration:** 13,000 youth were trained and deployed to register 3 million children for birth registration. Each youth completed a structured training opportunity before undertaking the fieldwork itself — a separate, verifiable activity. Sequencing a learning opportunity before a volunteering opportunity is a useful pattern for complex programmes that require youth to be trained before deployment.

**South Africa — Water Quality Monitoring:** 1,000 youth were trained in water quality monitoring techniques and deployed to test community water sources. Geotagged photographic evidence and structured data readings served as verifiable proof of completion, enabling both individual credential issuance and aggregate data collection for public health reporting.

**Philippines — Workshops:** Training providers listed free workshop places as non-learning opportunities, where completing the workshop and submitting a reflection was the evidence of completion. This model works particularly well for partners who run regular programmes and want to extend their reach without changing how they deliver.

These examples are covered in more depth across the section. For the mechanics of getting opportunities listed, start with [Creating an Opportunity](03-04-creating-an-opportunity.md).
