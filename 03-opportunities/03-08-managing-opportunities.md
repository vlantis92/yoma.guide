# Managing Opportunities

*Last updated: February 2026*

Publishing an opportunity is not the end of the work — it's the beginning. Active opportunities need monitoring, and partners need support in managing their listings beyond the initial setup. This article covers the ongoing responsibilities for both partners and your implementing organisation once listings are live.

## Editing Live Opportunities

Organisation Admins can edit most fields on a live opportunity at any time via the partner portal. This includes the title, description, Zlto value, duration, skills tags, and geographic targeting.

A few things to keep in mind when editing live listings:

**Changing the Zlto value** affects youth who are currently partway through completing the opportunity but haven't yet submitted proof. If you lower the value, youth who started under the original terms will receive the reduced amount. Communicate value changes in advance where possible, and avoid reductions mid-cycle.

**Changing the verification method** from manual review to QR/link (or vice versa) will affect submissions already in the queue — they may need to be cleared or re-processed manually. Avoid switching verification methods once completions are coming in.

**Changing the description** is generally low-risk, and often useful — opportunity descriptions frequently need refinement once real youth engagement reveals what's confusing or missing.

> 💡 **Tip:** Encourage partners to treat their first round of submissions as a feedback loop. If youth are uploading the wrong type of evidence, the description probably needs to be clearer. If submissions are being rejected at a high rate, the requirements may be ambiguous. Edit and improve early.

## Monitoring Participation

Organisation Admins can view participation data for their opportunities via the organisation admin dashboard on Yoma. This includes:

- Number of youth who have applied or started the opportunity
- Number of completions submitted (pending verification)
- Number of verified completions (approved)
- Number of rejections issued

This data is visible in the dashboard but currently **cannot be exported or downloaded** — there is no CSV export or API access to analytics data. A data download feature is on the roadmap for Q4 2026. See [Data and Reporting](../06-operations/06-03-data-and-reporting.md) for the current landscape and workarounds.

Use the dashboard to identify underperforming opportunities early. If an opportunity has been live for several weeks with few or no submissions, investigate whether the Zlto value is too low, the description is unclear, or the activity is simply not resonating with your youth demographic.

## Handling Underperforming Opportunities

If an opportunity isn't getting engagement, the levers you can pull are:

**Increase the Zlto value.** If youth are completing similar opportunities on the platform for more Zlto, a misaligned value is a likely culprit. A modest increase can restart engagement without fundamentally changing the nature of the activity.

**Rewrite the description.** Read the listing with fresh eyes — ideally ask a young person to read it. Is it clear what they need to do? Does it feel achievable? Is the time commitment stated clearly? Often a description problem can be solved in 15 minutes.

**Promote it through off-platform channels.** The Yoma marketplace doesn't actively surface specific listings to youth — discovery is largely through browsing and search. If an opportunity isn't being seen, promote it through your WhatsApp groups, ambassador network, or social media channels.

**Reconsider the fit.** Some opportunities simply don't fit the demographic. A highly technical data collection task that assumes digital literacy may underperform if most of your youth cohort is offline-first. In these cases, closing the listing and working with the partner to redesign the opportunity may be the right call.

## Closing and Archiving Opportunities

When an opportunity has run its course — the programme has ended, capacity has been filled, or the activity is no longer relevant — close it from the partner portal. Closed opportunities no longer appear in the marketplace for new youth to discover.

Before closing:

1. **Check for pending submissions** in the verification queue. Any youth who submitted proof before closing should have their submissions reviewed — don't abandon youth who completed the activity in good faith.
2. **Notify youth** who may be partway through (via your off-platform channels) that the opportunity is closing and they should submit their completion evidence promptly.
3. **Confirm with the partner** that they're comfortable closing and that there are no outstanding commitments to youth who started.

Archived opportunities retain their participation data in the dashboard for reporting purposes.

## Supporting Partners with Ongoing Management

The implementing organisation's role doesn't end at onboarding. Partners — particularly smaller NGOs and community organisations with limited digital capacity — will need ongoing support with the management tasks described in this article.

A lightweight support model for an active deployment:

- A monthly check-in with each active partner to review their participation data and any management issues
- A clear contact point (usually within your team) for partners to raise issues or ask questions
- Proactive outreach when you spot a partner whose verification queue has been idle for more than a week — slow verification directly affects youth engagement across your ecosystem

The goal is partners who manage their listings confidently and independently. See [Partner Support Model](../06-operations/06-02-partner-support-model.md) for the full operational support framework.
