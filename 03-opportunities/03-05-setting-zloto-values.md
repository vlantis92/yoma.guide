# Setting Zlto Values

*Last updated: February 2026*

Zlto values are the mechanism by which youth recognise whether their effort is being fairly rewarded. Set them well and the economy hums; set them poorly — too generous, too stingy, or inconsistently across your partner network — and youth lose motivation quickly. This article covers how to calibrate Zlto values for individual opportunities in a way that's fair, consistent, and aligned with your broader points economy.

## The Reference Point

Zlto has a fixed global reference value: **100 Zlto ≈ 5 USD**. This gives you an anchor — an opportunity worth roughly an hour of a young person's time, in a market where youth time is valued at minimum wage, might be worth around 50–100 Zlto. An opportunity requiring significant multi-day commitment might justify 400–500 Zlto.

These are starting points, not rules. The goal is that the Zlto value reflects the genuine effort required, and that the resulting accumulation of Zlto over time creates a meaningful path to the rewards in the marketplace.

Before setting values for individual opportunities, make sure you've read [Planning Your Points Economy](../02-getting-started/02-04-planning-your-points-economy.md) and [Pricing Rewards in Zlto](../04-rewards/04-05-pricing-rewards-in-zloto.md). Opportunity values and reward prices need to be designed together — they're two sides of the same equation.

## The Calibration Range

Use this table as your working reference:

| Effort level | Zlto range | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Very low effort (< 30 min) | 20–50 Zlto | Completing a short quiz, watching a video and submitting a reflection, signing up for an event |
| Low effort (30–60 min) | 50–100 Zlto | A single online module, a short community task, a brief survey-based data collection |
| Moderate effort (1–3 hours) | 100–250 Zlto | Attending a workshop, completing a multi-part course module, a half-day community activity |
| Significant effort (3–8 hours) | 250–400 Zlto | A full-day event, multi-session training programme, a structured data collection assignment |
| High commitment (ongoing / multi-day) | 400–500+ Zlto | Extended volunteering placements, multi-week programmes, complex fieldwork assignments |

> ℹ️ **Note:** These ranges are guides, not hard limits. A particularly impactful opportunity — for instance, one that generates high-quality data for a national programme — might justify a higher Zlto value regardless of raw time investment, because the value of the youth's contribution extends beyond the hours they put in.

## Calibrating Against Your Reward Prices

The most important calibration check is this: can a youth who participates actively for a typical month accumulate enough Zlto to redeem something meaningful from the rewards marketplace?

Work through a simple scenario:

1. What are your lowest-priced rewards? (These should be accessible within the first few completions.)
2. What are your mid-range rewards? (These should be achievable with consistent engagement over 2–4 weeks.)
3. What are your aspirational rewards? (These should require sustained participation over months.)

If your opportunities are priced at 50–100 Zlto and your cheapest reward costs 500 Zlto, youth will accumulate Zlto with no visible progress toward redemption. If everything in the rewards marketplace costs 50 Zlto and opportunities pay 200 Zlto, Zlto accumulates faster than it can be spent meaningfully, and it loses its value as a motivation mechanism.

The worked example in [Pricing Rewards in Zlto](../04-rewards/04-05-pricing-rewards-in-zloto.md) walks through this calibration from the rewards side. Read both articles together.

## The Risk of Getting It Wrong

**Over-valuing** opportunities (too much Zlto for too little effort) devalues the currency. If youth can earn 500 Zlto by watching a two-minute video, the rewards that cost 500 Zlto feel cheap — and partners who have created genuinely demanding opportunities feel their contribution isn't being fairly differentiated.

**Under-valuing** is more common, and more damaging. Youth who complete a meaningful two-hour activity and receive 20 Zlto will — correctly — conclude that the effort isn't worth it. Low Zlto values on real opportunities also suggest to youth that the rewards are unattainably expensive, even if they're not.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Zlto values can be edited after publication, but changes affect the motivation of youth who are currently partway through an opportunity. If you reduce a value post-launch, youth who haven't yet completed may feel the deal has changed on them. Adjust values with care, and preferably before significant numbers of youth are engaged.

## Coordinating Across Partners

In a multi-partner deployment, different organisations will have different ideas about what Zlto is worth. A corporate partner used to paying interns may default to high values; a community NGO used to volunteer stipends may default to low ones. Without coordination, you end up with inconsistent values that confuse youth and undermine trust in the economy.

Your implementing organisation sets the tone. Before partners go live, share a simple reference document — a version of the table above, adapted for your market and calibrated against your reward prices — so all partners are working from the same framework.

When reviewing a partner's draft listings before they go live, check the Zlto values explicitly. It's easier to align them at the listing stage than to manage a post-launch repricing conversation.

### Example: Barbados — Calibrating the Points Economy at Launch

For the Barbados pilot, the target reward is a BBD 10 airtime voucher — priced at 200 Zlto. Working backwards: youth need to complete approximately four moderate-effort opportunities (each paying around 50 Zlto) to reach their first redemption. That feels achievable within a week of active participation. More aspirational rewards — monthly data bundles, local retail vouchers — sit at 400–600 Zlto, requiring sustained engagement over 2–4 weeks. The aspiration of a university scholarship access listing at a high threshold provides a long-term retention anchor for the most motivated youth.
