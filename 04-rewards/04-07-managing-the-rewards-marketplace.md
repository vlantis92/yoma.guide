# Managing the Rewards Marketplace

*Last updated: February 2026*

Getting rewards live is the beginning, not the end. A rewards marketplace that isn't actively managed quickly develops gaps — depleted stock, stale listings, rewards that no longer resonate. This article covers the ongoing management responsibilities that keep the demand side of your ecosystem working.

## What You're Managing

Your day-to-day management responsibilities fall into four areas:

- **Stock monitoring** — tracking voucher code inventory and triggering replenishment before stock runs out.
- **Catalogue health** — retiring rewards that have expired, adding new ones to maintain variety.
- **Redemption data** — reviewing what's being redeemed, what isn't, and what that tells you.
- **Partner relationships** — maintaining the connections that keep the catalogue supplied and growing.

None of this is technically complex. The challenge is doing it consistently, especially as your deployment scales and the number of active rewards grows.

## Stock Monitoring and Replenishment

For voucher code rewards, stock is finite. When codes run out, the reward disappears from the marketplace until new codes are loaded. Youth who were working toward a reward they can no longer see — or who try to redeem and find it unavailable — will be frustrated. Manage stock proactively, not reactively.

A practical approach:

1. **Set a replenishment threshold** for each voucher code reward. When stock drops below that threshold (e.g., 20 remaining codes), trigger a new code procurement from the partner.
2. **Send the new codes to the Zlto team** with a request to load them. Include the reward listing reference so there's no ambiguity about which reward they apply to.
3. **Confirm the stock count has been updated** in the marketplace once the Zlto team confirms loading.

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep a local spreadsheet tracking each active reward, its current stock level (as last reported by the Zlto team), the replenishment threshold, and when you last requested a top-up. The platform doesn't send automatic stock alerts — this visibility has to be built manually.

For non-contract rewards (workshop places, events), stock management means confirming with the partner that capacity is still available and updating the listing if event dates or places change.

## Reviewing Redemption Data

Redemption patterns tell you which rewards are working and which aren't. The Zlto team can share redemption data with you on request. Use it to answer:

- **Which rewards are most popular?** These should be prioritised for replenishment and may warrant negotiating larger code batches.
- **Which rewards are rarely redeemed?** Either the Zlto price is too high, the reward isn't relevant to your youth demographic, or it's not visible enough. Try lowering the price or retiring the listing and replacing it with something more relevant.
- **What's the redemption velocity?** If a reward exhausts its stock within days of being loaded, you either need a larger batch or a higher Zlto price to manage demand.

> ℹ️ **Note:** There is currently no self-service data export or analytics dashboard available to implementing organisations for the rewards marketplace. Request data directly from the Zlto team, and factor their response time into your reporting cycle. A CSV export feature is on the Yoma roadmap for Q4 2026 — see [Data and Reporting](../06-operations/06-03-data-and-reporting.md) for the current landscape.

## Retiring and Adding Rewards

**Retiring a reward** is straightforward — contact the Zlto team and request the listing be removed or marked as out of stock. Do this when:

- Voucher codes have been exhausted and the partner can't (or won't) replenish.
- An event or workshop has passed and there's no follow-up session.
- A reward is consistently underperforming and replacing it with something more relevant makes more sense than repricing.

**Adding new rewards** follows the full coordination workflow in [Working with the Zlto Team](04-04-working-with-the-zloto-team.md). Batch your requests where possible — sending multiple new listings to the Zlto team at once is more efficient than drip-feeding them one at a time.

## Keeping the Catalogue Fresh

A stale rewards catalogue is a quiet killer of youth engagement. Youth who visit the marketplace and see the same listings they've already redeemed — or the same listings they can't yet afford — stop visiting. Freshness signals that the programme is alive and worth checking back on.

Practical ways to keep the catalogue active:

- **Rotate seasonal rewards** — local events, holiday promotions, back-to-school offers. These don't require new partners; they're existing partners offering time-limited items.
- **Feature new rewards prominently** — coordinate with the Zlto team on whether new listings can be marked as "new" or featured at the top of the catalogue.
- **Use campaigns** — a short-run high-value reward tied to a challenge or push period (e.g., "complete three opportunities this month and unlock a bonus reward") creates urgency and drives engagement spikes. Non-contract rewards work well for this.
- **Set a quarterly review rhythm** — at the start of each quarter, assess what's live, what's underperforming, and what new partners or reward types could be added.

Partner renewals are part of this rhythm too. Voucher code relationships benefit from periodic check-ins — making sure the partner is still willing to supply codes, updating them on redemption numbers (which are positive news for them), and exploring whether they'd like to offer additional products or increased stock.

## Minimum Viable Ongoing Effort

For a pilot-scale deployment, the core management tasks per month are roughly:

| Task | Frequency | Effort |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Check stock levels across active rewards | Weekly | 15 minutes |
| Request replenishment as needed | As triggered | 30 minutes per request |
| Review redemption data from Zlto team | Monthly | 1 hour |
| Retire underperforming or expired rewards | Quarterly | 1–2 hours |
| Add new rewards | Quarterly (minimum) | Depends on partner pipeline |
| Partner check-ins | Quarterly | 30 minutes per partner |

This is manageable for one person alongside other responsibilities — provided the partner relationships are in good shape and the Zlto team communication cadence is established. As the deployment scales, the volume of all of the above increases proportionally.
