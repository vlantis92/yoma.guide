# Reward Partner Examples

*Last updated: February 2026*

The best way to understand how reward partnerships work in practice is to look at what existing deployments have built. Each example below illustrates a different reward model, a different partner type, or a different market context — with notes on what made it work and what's worth replicating.

## Voucher Code Model: South Africa

South Africa has the most developed rewards marketplace in any Yoma deployment, with over 100 participating companies spanning retail, food and beverage, wellness, tech, and telcos. Youth use their Zlto to purchase goods and services directly from participating stores.

What makes the South African model distinctive is a specific legislative arrangement: participating companies can write off the value of youth redemptions as tax-deductible in-kind donations. This dramatically lowers the perceived cost of participation for corporate partners and has driven broad uptake across sectors. Youth purchasing a grocery item with Zlto, for instance, is treated as a charitable donation from the retailer's perspective.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This tax incentive mechanism relies on specific South African legislation and cannot be directly replicated in other markets. In new deployments, the value proposition for reward partners rests on CSR alignment, youth audience access, and brand visibility rather than tax deductibility. The South Africa example is inspiring, but use it to illustrate scale — not as a promise of the same commercial model.

The South African experience demonstrates what's possible when a rewards marketplace reaches maturity. Getting there took years of relationship-building by the Zlto team. New deployments will start much smaller — which is fine, as long as the initial catalogue has enough depth to motivate youth engagement.

## Voucher Code Model: Nigeria — SureGifts

Nigeria's deployment solved the cold-start problem elegantly by partnering with SureGifts (suregifts.com.ng), an existing Nigerian voucher marketplace. Rather than recruiting dozens of individual retail partners, the deployment gained access to SureGifts' entire catalogue — airtime, clothing, electronics, food, and more — through a single integration.

Cash vouchers of multiple denominations were purchased from SureGifts and loaded into the Yoma rewards marketplace with equivalent Zlto prices. Youth who redeemed received a unique SureGifts voucher code they could use on the SureGifts platform to purchase anything in the catalogue.

This approach is replicable anywhere a comparable voucher aggregator exists. The key advantages: one partner relationship gives you many reward options, the brand is already trusted by your youth demographic, and the voucher code model means fulfilment is fully automated. If a voucher marketplace exists in your market, it is likely your fastest path to a compelling rewards catalogue at launch.

## Non-Contract Model: Philippines — Workshop RSVPs

In the Philippines, Yoma partnered with training providers to offer free weekend workshops as rewards. Youth spent Zlto to RSVP and secure their place — no voucher codes, no automated code delivery. Redemption simply confirmed the youth's intent to attend.

This non-contract model required a clear agreement with each training partner on how RSVP data would be shared and how no-shows would be handled. But the barrier to getting these rewards live was low: no code procurement, no stock to manage, just a listing and a fulfilment process.

Workshop and event RSVPs work particularly well as rewards when the opportunity portfolio already skews toward learning and skills development. Youth who are completing training opportunities have a natural appetite for more learning — a workshop RSVP as a reward reinforces the same behaviour rather than redirecting it toward consumption.

## Aspirational Reward: International University of Applied Sciences

One of the more creative uses of the rewards marketplace is a cross-border scholarship partnership with the International University of Applied Sciences. Degree programme registrations — in-kind grants covering the full value of a masters programme — are listed in the rewards marketplace at a high Zlto threshold, accessible to youth across Africa.

Youth who have earned enough Zlto through sustained participation can use it to access the scholarship registration form. The reward is aspirational by design: it requires consistent engagement over a long period, which means it serves as a retention mechanism as much as a reward.

This example illustrates two important principles. First, rewards don't have to be consumable — access to life-changing opportunities is a legitimate and powerful reward. Second, high-threshold aspirational rewards require a healthy mid-range catalogue beneath them: youth need to feel progress at every stage of their Zlto accumulation, not just at the finish line.

## What These Examples Have in Common

Across all of these deployments, a few patterns hold:

- **Partner diversity matters.** A catalogue with airtime *and* workshops *and* an aspirational scholarship serves more of the youth demographic than any single category alone.
- **The cold-start problem has a workaround.** Whether it's SureGifts in Nigeria or a single reliable telco in your market, finding one partner with broad reach can stand in for many individual relationships while the ecosystem grows.
- **Reward models can be mixed freely.** South Africa uses voucher codes at scale; the Philippines uses non-contract RSVPs; the university scholarship is a bespoke high-threshold listing. The same marketplace supports all three simultaneously.
