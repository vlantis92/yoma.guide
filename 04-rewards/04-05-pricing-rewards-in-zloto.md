# Pricing Rewards in Zlto

*Last updated: February 2026*

Reward pricing is where your points economy becomes real. Set prices well and youth feel that their effort translates into something tangible. Set them poorly — too high, too low, or inconsistently — and the Zlto motivation collapses. This article covers how to price rewards in a way that's fair, sustainable, and coherent across your deployment.

## The Reference Value

Zlto has a fixed global reference value: **100 Zlto ≈ 5 USD**. This is not an exchange rate — Zlto cannot be converted to cash in most deployments — but it gives you an anchor for calibrating reward prices against real-world value.

Before pricing any individual reward, make sure you've read [Planning Your Points Economy](../02-getting-started/02-04-planning-your-points-economy.md). Reward pricing and opportunity Zlto values are two sides of the same equation. They need to be designed together.

## The Core Calculation

The starting point for pricing any reward is straightforward:

1. Establish the real-world value of the reward in USD (or your local currency converted to USD).
2. Apply the reference conversion: 100 Zlto = 5 USD, or 20 Zlto per USD.
3. Use the result as a baseline Zlto price.
4. Adjust up or down based on strategic considerations (see below).

**Worked example:**

A BBD 10 airtime voucher (Barbados dollars, where BBD 2 = USD 1) has a real-world value of USD 5. Applying the reference rate: USD 5 × 20 = **200 Zlto**.

| Reward | Real-world value | USD equivalent | Base Zlto price |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| BBD 10 airtime voucher | BBD 10 | USD 5 | 200 Zlto |
| USD 5 data bundle | USD 5 | USD 5 | 200 Zlto |
| USD 10 retail voucher | USD 10 | USD 10 | 400 Zlto |
| Free workshop place (USD 20 value) | USD 20 | USD 20 | 800 Zlto |
| University scholarship access | High | High | 1,000–2,000 Zlto |

> ℹ️ **Note:** The reference conversion gives you a principled starting point, not a rigid rule. The goal is that reward prices feel fair and attainable — not that every reward perfectly mirrors its market price. A small adjustment in either direction is fine if it makes the economy feel more coherent.

## The Effort-to-Reward Question

Once you have a baseline price, ask: how many opportunities does a youth need to complete to earn this reward?

Given typical opportunity Zlto values (see [Setting Zlto Values](../03-opportunities/03-05-setting-zloto-values.md) for the full range), a 200 Zlto reward is accessible after a handful of low-to-medium effort activities. A 1,000 Zlto reward requires sustained engagement over weeks or months.

Both ends of this spectrum serve a purpose:

- **Low-threshold rewards** (50–300 Zlto) are important for new users — they give youth an early win and prove the system works. Make sure you have something accessible in this range at launch.
- **Mid-range rewards** (300–800 Zlto) sustain ongoing engagement. They're achievable with consistent participation over a few weeks.
- **Aspirational rewards** (800 Zlto+) create longer-term motivation and retention. University scholarship access is the classic example — a youth who knows they're working towards a scholarship registration threshold will stay active for months.

> 💡 **Tip:** At launch, front-load your catalogue with low- and mid-range rewards. An empty top shelf is fine — youth will engage with what's available. A catalogue where nothing is within reach in the first month will cause drop-off before youth develop the habit.

## Adjusting for Strategic Fit

The base calculation is a starting point. Adjust the Zlto price upward or downward based on:

**Adjust up if:** The reward is high-demand and you need to manage redemption volume against limited supply. A higher Zlto price naturally paces demand without you having to manually limit stock as frequently.

**Adjust down if:** You want to use the reward as an entry-point hook — something that converts first-time users into active participants. A deliberately accessible first reward can be worth subsidising slightly below fair value.

**Adjust to match your opportunity mix:** If your opportunity portfolio skews heavily toward low-Zlto activities (50–150 Zlto), make sure your rewards catalogue has plenty of options in the 200–400 Zlto range — otherwise youth will accumulate Zlto with no immediate redemption path, and motivation stalls.

## Coordinating Prices Across the Ecosystem

Reward pricing cannot be set in isolation. It needs to be coordinated with:

- **The Zlto team** — who create and manage listings. Agree the Zlto price with them before the listing goes live. Don't assume they'll set a price on your behalf.
- **Your opportunity partners** — if partners are setting their own Zlto values, review them against your reward prices. A partner who sets every opportunity at 10 Zlto will frustrate youth who can see rewards starting at 200 Zlto.
- **Your implementing organisation's M&E goals** — if funders want to see specific engagement levels, reward pricing directly affects participation rates.

## Reviewing and Adjusting

Reward prices aren't permanent. Once your deployment is live, watch redemption data. Rewards with very high redemption rates relative to supply may need a price increase to manage stock. Rewards that rarely get redeemed may be priced too high, or simply not relevant to your youth demographic.

Build a pricing review into your quarterly operational rhythm. Coordinate any changes with the Zlto team — listing updates go through them, as covered in [Working with the Zlto Team](04-04-working-with-the-zloto-team.md).
