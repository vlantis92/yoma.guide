# Recruiting Reward Partners

*Last updated: February 2026*

Reward partners are what make the Yoma ecosystem worth joining for youth. Without a compelling rewards catalogue, Zlto has no purchasing power — and without Zlto as motivation, youth have no reason to complete opportunities. Building your rewards pipeline is not a secondary task; it needs to begin at the same time as opportunity partner recruitment.

## Who to Target

Reward partners are organisations willing to offer products or services in exchange for Zlto redemption. The Yoma marketplace is organised into ten official categories, which also serve as a useful framework for mapping your prospective partner landscape:

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Airtime & Data | Mobile operators, MVNOs |
| Connectivity | WiFi vouchers, internet café credits |
| Electricity | Prepaid electricity providers |
| Food | Restaurants, fast food, food delivery |
| Beverages | Cafés, juice bars, beverage brands |
| Education | Training providers, online courses, tutoring |
| Lifestyle | Fashion, entertainment, leisure |
| Health and Wellness | Gyms, pharmacies, wellness services |
| Transport | Ride-hailing, bus passes, fuel vouchers |
| Technology – Electronics | Device accessories, software, tech stores |

Not every category will be relevant or available in every market. Use this as a prompt for stakeholder mapping, not a checklist that must be completed before launch.

**Airtime & Data** is typically your highest-priority target. Airtime and data bundles have near-universal appeal to young people and are a marginal-cost product for mobile operators — the real cost of donating data is low relative to the goodwill and brand exposure generated. In Barbados, Flow and Digicel are the primary telco targets; in Nigeria, mobile data bundles have been a core redemption driver. Wherever you're deploying, lead with this category.

**Food, Beverages, and Lifestyle** offer voucher code rewards that work well within the standard redemption model. Youth can see the real-world value clearly, which makes these rewards easy to communicate in acquisition and re-engagement marketing.

**Education** partners can list free courses, workshop places, or event access as non-contract rewards (no voucher codes required), which align naturally with the Grow pillar of the Yoma framework and have a low barrier to partner onboarding.

**Health and Wellness, Transport, and Technology** round out the catalogue with variety and appeal to specific youth interests and needs.

Before approaching individual organisations, map your landscape using the stakeholder framework in [Stakeholder Mapping](../02-getting-started/02-03-stakeholder-mapping.md). Prioritise partners whose offering has broad appeal across your target youth demographic's age and income profile.

## The Value Proposition

Reward partners join Yoma for different reasons depending on their sector and market context. The core pitch has several angles — lead with whichever resonates most:

| Angle | Key message | Works best for |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Brand visibility** | Your brand is displayed in a marketplace used by 311,000+ young people across six countries. It's visible, searchable, and associated with positive action. | Consumer brands, retailers |
| **Youth audience access** | Youth who redeem rewards from you are already engaged, active, and motivated — a higher-quality audience than a passive ad impression. | Telcos, tech brands |
| **CSR and social impact** | Participation in Yoma demonstrates measurable investment in youth development, contributing to verifiable SDG outcomes. | Corporates with CSR mandates, foundations |
| **Low operational burden** | Once the reward is listed, you do nothing. The Zlto team manages the catalogue. Youth redeem independently. There's no customer service overhead on your side. | Any partner type |
| **No cost to join** | The Yoma platform is completely free for reward partners. | Any partner, especially smaller organisations |

> ℹ️ **Note:** In South Africa, a unique legislative arrangement allows participating companies to write off the value of youth redemptions as tax-deductible in-kind donations. This has made the SA rewards marketplace one of the most extensive in any Yoma deployment — over 100 participating companies. This mechanism relies on specific South African tax law and is not directly replicable in other markets. In other deployments, the value proposition rests on CSR alignment and audience access rather than tax incentive.

## Approaching Partners

Start with warm contacts — organisations you or your stakeholders already have relationships with. A direct ask from a known contact converts far better than a cold pitch.

For cold outreach, lead with the social mission rather than the platform mechanics. The opening message should be about what youth in your market are doing and what this partner can offer them — not about software features. Once interest is established, walk through how the reward model works in a short conversation or demonstration.

**Common objections and responses:**

*"We don't have the budget for this."* — Clarify that the cost depends on the reward model. For telcos and data providers, the marginal cost of donating units is minimal. For non-contract rewards like workshop places, there may be no direct cost at all.

*"How do we know youth will actually redeem from us?"* — Point to the incentive structure: youth are earning Zlto specifically to spend it. Redemption rates on well-priced, relevant rewards are consistently high in existing deployments.

*"What's the ongoing commitment?"* — For voucher code rewards, the commitment is supplying codes in batches as stock depletes. For non-contract rewards, it's as simple as confirming event or workshop capacity. The Zlto team handles the rest.

## What to Agree Before Handoff

Before passing a reward partner to the Zlto team, make sure you've aligned on the following:

1. **Reward type** — voucher code, non-contract, or (from 2026) cash equivalent. See [Types of Rewards](04-03-types-of-rewards.md) for the full breakdown.
2. **Reward description and details** — what youth are actually receiving, any eligibility conditions, and how fulfilment works.
3. **Initial stock or capacity** — how many units are available at launch.
4. **Zlto pricing** — a provisional price, which you'll finalise with the Zlto team. See [Pricing Rewards in Zlto](04-05-pricing-rewards-in-zloto.md) for guidance.
5. **Replenishment cadence** — how often the partner will supply new codes or confirm continued capacity.

Once these are agreed, hand over to the Zlto team. The partner doesn't need to do anything on the platform directly. See [Working with the Zlto Team](04-04-working-with-the-zloto-team.md) for what happens next.
