# Working with the Zlto Team

*Last updated: February 2026*

> **Before you begin:**
> - You should have at least one reward partner recruited and terms agreed — see [Recruiting Reward Partners](04-02-recruiting-reward-partners.md)
> - You should understand the three reward models before coordinating with the Zlto team — see [Types of Rewards](04-03-types-of-rewards.md)

The Zlto team is the operational engine behind Yoma's rewards marketplace. Understanding how to work with them effectively — and what depends on them — is one of the most important things to get right early in your deployment.

## Who Is the Zlto Team?

**Zlto (zlto.co) is a separate organisation from Yoma.** It is an independent South African NGO that provides the rewards and token infrastructure that Yoma runs on. When youth earn Zlto tokens and redeem them for rewards, the Zlto team administers that entire backend.

This means your implementing organisation does not have direct access to create, edit, or retire reward listings. Everything on the rewards side of the marketplace goes through the Zlto team.

## Division of Responsibilities

It helps to be clear from the start about what each party owns:

| Task                                         | Who is responsible                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recruiting reward partners                   | Implementing organisation                                      |
| Negotiating reward terms and pricing         | Implementing organisation (in consultation with Zlto team)     |
| Procuring voucher codes from reward partners | Implementing organisation (in most markets)                    |
| Creating and publishing reward listings      | Zlto team                                                      |
| Managing reward stock in the marketplace     | Zlto team                                                      |
| Monitoring redemption data                   | Zlto team (data shared with implementing org on request)       |
| Replenishing voucher codes                   | Implementing organisation supplies codes; Zlto team loads them |
| Retiring expired or depleted rewards         | Zlto team, on request from implementing organisation           |
| Holding direct partner relationships         | Varies by market (see below)                                   |

## Two Market Models

The implementing organisation's role in partner relationships varies depending on how your deployment is structured:

**Locally-managed relationships (most new deployments):** Your implementing organisation holds the direct relationship with each reward partner. You negotiate terms, procure codes, and act as the primary point of contact. You then pass materials to the Zlto team, who configure the listing. This is the expected model for a new market deployment such as Barbados.

**Zlto-managed relationships:** In South Africa, the Zlto team holds direct contractual relationships with many reward partners. The implementing organisation in South Africa benefits from an existing catalogue without needing to build it from scratch. This depth of relationship takes years to develop and is not immediately available in new markets.

If you're launching in a new market, plan to hold all reward partner relationships yourself — at least initially.

## The Coordination Workflow

For each new reward you want to add to the marketplace, the process is:

1. **Agree the reward with your partner** — what is being offered, in what quantity, for how long.
2. **Determine the reward model** — voucher code, non-contract, or cash equivalent (see [Types of Rewards](04-03-types-of-rewards.md)).
3. **Agree a Zlto price** — work this out before going to the Zlto team. See [Pricing Rewards in Zlto](04-05-pricing-rewards-in-zloto.md) for guidance.
4. **For voucher code rewards:** Procure the initial batch of codes from your reward partner and send them to the Zlto team along with the listing details (name, description, image, Zlto price, stock count).
5. **For non-contract rewards:** Send the Zlto team the listing details and any RSVP/fulfilment instructions. No codes required.
6. **Zlto team creates the listing** — confirm the live listing looks correct and the Zlto price matches what was agreed.
7. **Monitor and replenish** — when stock runs low, supply a new batch of codes to the Zlto team for loading.

> 💡 **Tip:** Send the Zlto team a clear brief for each reward listing — including the exact wording you want for the description, the image, and the Zlto price. The more complete your brief, the less back-and-forth, and the faster the reward goes live.

## Communication Cadence

Establish a regular communication rhythm with the Zlto team from the outset. For an active deployment, a weekly or fortnightly check-in covering the following is a reasonable baseline:

- Rewards approaching low stock that need replenishment
- New rewards ready to be listed
- Rewards to retire or update
- Any redemption issues reported by youth

For urgent issues — a reward listing displaying incorrectly, a code batch that's been exhausted faster than expected — have a direct contact at the Zlto team identified before launch, not after.

> ⚠️ **Important:** The Zlto team is a shared resource supporting multiple deployments globally. Build realistic turnaround expectations into your planning. New reward listings typically don't go live instantly — factor a few days of lead time when planning any campaign or launch.

## Managing the Dependency

Working through a third party for all reward configuration is an operational constraint that requires proactive management. Deployers who handle it well share a few common practices:

- **Batch requests.** Rather than sending one reward at a time, consolidate requests for new listings, updates, and retirements into a single brief.
- **Brief early.** Don't wait until a reward partner is ready to launch before contacting the Zlto team. Share upcoming rewards in advance so they can plan.
- **Keep a local tracker.** Maintain your own record of what's live, what stock level each reward is at, and when replenishment is due — don't rely entirely on the Zlto team to surface this.
- **Build the relationship.** The Zlto team is a partner, not a ticketing system. Regular communication and goodwill make the coordination work better.
