# Types of Rewards

*Last updated: February 2026*

Not all rewards work the same way. Yoma supports three distinct reward models, each with different operational requirements, fulfilment mechanics, and partner implications. Choosing the right model — or the right mix — for your market will shape how you recruit partners and coordinate with the Zlto team.

## The Three Reward Models

### Model 1: Voucher Code Rewards

This is the most common model and the one with the most seamless youth experience.

The implementing organisation (or sometimes the Zlto team directly) purchases a batch of voucher codes from the reward partner. These codes are loaded into the rewards marketplace, each paired with a Zlto price. When a youth redeems a reward, a unique code is automatically delivered to them — no manual fulfilment required.

**Good for:** Airtime and data bundles, retail gift vouchers, product discounts, food and beverage offers — anything that can be tokenised into a redeemable code.

**Operational requirements:** Someone must purchase and supply codes in advance. Codes are finite — when stock runs out, the reward disappears from the catalogue until replenished. A replenishment cadence needs to be agreed with the partner from the outset.

**Fulfilment:** Fully automated once codes are loaded. Youth receive the code immediately on redemption; no action required from the partner or your team.

### Model 2: Non-Contract Rewards

Non-contract rewards are listed in the marketplace without any voucher codes. Instead, redemption serves as an RSVP or expression of interest. The Zlto team creates the listing; when a youth redeems it, they complete a form, and fulfilment is handled outside the platform.

**Good for:** Free workshop places, event access, in-person experiences, mentorship sessions, and services where capacity is limited and attendance is the delivery mechanism.

**Operational requirements:** Lower barrier to get partners live — no codes to procure. The partner simply needs to confirm how many places are available and how they'll manage attendees. A clear fulfilment process must be agreed before the reward goes live.

**Fulfilment:** Not automated. The partner (or your team) is responsible for confirming the RSVP and delivering the experience. Build this into your partner onboarding conversation.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Because fulfilment is manual, non-contract rewards can create support overhead if the process isn't clear. Make sure youth know what to expect after redemption — and make sure the partner knows what they're committing to.

### Model 3: Cash Equivalent Rewards (2026)

This model is in development and planned for release in 2026 via a Chimoney integration. The implementing organisation funds a monetary amount to the Zlto team, who list a cash equivalent reward. Youth who redeem it receive a direct cash transfer in exchange for their Zlto balance.

**Good for:** Deployments where youth need liquid value rather than specific products — particularly relevant in markets where the rewards catalogue is thin or where supplementing livelihoods is an explicit programme goal.

**Operational requirements:** Requires an upfront monetary commitment from the implementing organisation or a funder. The Chimoney integration handles the actual transfer.

**Status:** Planned for 2026. If this model is important to your deployment, track updates via [Roadmap Features](../07-reference/07-04-roadmap-features.md).

## Choosing the Right Model

Most deployments use a mix of all three — or at least the first two. A useful starting framework:

| If your goal is…                                             | Lead with…                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast launch with minimal partner complexity                  | Non-contract rewards — low setup friction                |
| Maximum youth appeal and high redemption rates               | Voucher code rewards — immediate, tangible value         |
| Broad market coverage without specific partners              | A SureGifts-style voucher marketplace (Model 1 at scale) |
| Livelihood supplementation                                   | Cash equivalent rewards (from 2026)                      |
| Encouraging specific behaviours (event attendance, training) | Non-contract rewards for those specific activities       |

All reward listings are configured by the Zlto team regardless of which model you use. See [Working with the Zlto Team](04-04-working-with-the-zloto-team.md) for how the coordination workflow differs between models.
